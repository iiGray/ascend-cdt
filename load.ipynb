VII.--APRIL, 1861.--NO. XLII.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPRIL DAYS.\\n\\n\\n  \"Can trouble dwell with April days?\"\\n\\n_In Memoriam._\\n\\n\\nIn our methodical New England life, we still recognize some magic in\\nsummer. Most persons reluctantly resign themselves to being decently\\nhappy in June, at least. They accept June. They compliment its weather.\\nThey complained of the earlier months as cold, and so spent them in\\nthe city; and they will complain of the later months as hot, and so\\nrefrigerate themselves on some barren sea-coast. God offers us yearly a\\nnecklace of twelve pearls; most men choose the fairest, label it June,\\nand cast the rest away. It is time to chant a hymn of more liberal\\ngratitude.\\n\\nThere are no days in the whole round year more delicious than those\\nwhich often come to us in the latter half of April. On these days one\\ngoes forth in the morning, and an Italian warmth broods over all the\\nhills, taking visible shape in a glistening mist of silvered azure, with\\nwhich mingles the smoke from many bonfires. The sun trembles in his\\nown soft rays, till one understands the old English tradition, that he\\ndances on Easter-Day. Swimming in a sea of glory, the tops of the hills\\nlook nearer than their bases, and their glistening watercourses seem\\nclose to the eye, as is their liberated murmur to the ear. All across\\nthis broad interval the teams are ploughing. The grass in the meadow\\nseems all to have grown green since yesterday. The blackbirds jangle\\nin the oak, the robin is perched upon the elm, the song-sparrow on the\\nhazel, and the bluebird on the apple-tree. There rises a hawk and sails\\nslowly, the stateliest of airy things, a floating dream of long and\\nlanguid summer-hours. But as yet, though there is warmth enough for a\\nsense of luxury, there is coolness enough for exertion. No tropics can\\noffer such a burst of joy; indeed, no zone much warmer than our Northern\\nStates can offer a genuine spring. There can be none where there is no\\nwinter, and the monotone of the seasons is broken only by wearisome\\nrains. Vegetation and birds being distributed over the year, there is no\\nburst of verdure nor of song. But with us, as the buds are swelling, the\\nbirds are arriving; they are building their nests almost simultaneously;\\nand in all the Southern year there is no such rapture of beauty and of\\nmelody as here marks every morning from the last of April onward.\\n\\nBut days even earlier than these in April have a charm,--even days that\\nseem raw and rainy, when the sky is dull and a bequest of March-wind\\nlingers, chasing the squirrel from the tree and the children from the\\nmeadows. There is a fascination in walking through these bare early\\nwoods,--there is such a pause of preparation, winter\\'s work is so\\ncleanly and thoroughly done. Everything is taken down and put away;\\nthroughout the leafy arcades the branches show no remnant of last year,\\nsave a few twisted leaves of oak and beech, a few empty seed-vessels of\\nthe tardy witch-hazel, and a few gnawed nutshells dropped coquettishly\\nby the squirrels into the crevices of the bark. All else is bare, but\\nprophetic: buds everywhere, the whole splendor of the coming summer\\nconcentrated in those hard little knobs on every bough; and clinging\\nhere and there among them, a brown, papery chrysalis, from which shall\\nyet wave the superb wings of the Luna moth. An occasional shower patters\\non the dry leaves, but it does not silence the robin on the outskirts of\\nthe wood: indeed, he sings louder than ever, though the song-sparrow and\\nthe bluebird are silent.\\n\\nThen comes the sweetness of the nights in latter April. There is as yet\\nno evening-primrose to open suddenly, no cistus to drop its petals;\\nbut the May-flower knows the hour, and becomes more fragrant in the\\ndarkness, so that one can then often find it in the woods without\\naid from the eye. The pleasant night-sounds are begun; the hylas are\\nuttering their shrill _peep_ from the meadows, mingled soon with hoarser\\ntoads, who take to the water at this season to deposit their spawn. The\\ntree-toads soon join them; but one listens in vain for bullfrogs, or\\nkatydids, or grasshoppers, or whippoorwills, or crickets: we must wait\\nfor them until the delicious June.\\n\\nThe earliest familiar token of the coming season is the expansion of the\\nstiff catkins of the alder into soft, drooping tresses. These are so\\nsensitive, that, if you pluck them at almost any time during the winter,\\na day\\'s bright sunshine will make them open in a glass of water, and\\nthus they eagerly yield to every moment of April warmth. The blossom\\nof the birch is more delicate, that of the willow more showy, but the\\nalders come first. They cluster and dance everywhere upon the bare\\nboughs above the watercourses; the blackness of the buds is softened\\ninto rich brown and yellow; and as this graceful creature thus comes\\nwaving into the spring, it is pleasant to remember that the Norse Eddas\\nfabled the first woman to have been named Embla, because she was created\\nfrom an alder-bough.\\n\\nThe first wild-flower of the spring is like land after sea. The two\\nwhich, throughout the Northern Atlantic States, divide this interest are\\nthe _Epigaea repens_ (May-flower, ground-laurel, or trailing-arbutus)\\nand the _Hepatica triloba_ (liverleaf, liverwort, or blue anemone). Of\\nthese two, the latter is perhaps more immediately exciting on first\\ndiscovery; because it does not, like the epigaea, exhibit its buds all\\nwinter, but opens its blue eyes almost as soon as it emerges from the\\nground. Without the rich and delicious odor of its compeer, it has\\nan inexpressibly fresh and earthy scent, that seems to bring all the\\npromise of the blessed season with it; indeed, that clod of fresh turf\\nwith the inhalation of which Lord Bacon delighted to begin the day must\\nundoubtedly have been full of the roots of our little hepatica. Its\\nhealthy sweetness belongs to the opening year, like Chaucer\\'s poetry;\\nand one thinks that anything more potent and voluptuous would be less\\nenchanting,--until one turns to the May-flower. Then comes a richer\\nfascination for the senses. To pick the May-flower is like following in\\nthe footsteps of some spendthrift army which has scattered the contents\\nof its treasure-chest among beds of scented moss. The fingers sink in\\nthe soft, moist verdure, and make at each instant some superb discovery\\nunawares; again and again, straying carelessly, they clutch some new\\ntreasure; and, indeed, all is linked together in bright necklaces by\\nsecret threads beneath the surface, and where you grasp at one, you hold\\nmany. The hands go wandering over the moss as over the keys of a piano,\\nand bring forth fragrance for melody. The lovely creatures twine and\\nnestle and lay their glowing faces to the very earth beneath withered\\nleaves, and what seemed mere barrenness becomes fresh and fragrant\\nbeauty. So great is the charm of the pursuit, that the epigaea is really\\nthe one wild-flower for which our country-people have a hearty passion.\\nEvery village child knows its best haunts, and watches for it eagerly\\nin the spring; boys wreathe their hats with it, girls twine it in their\\nhair, and the cottage-windows are filled with its beauty.\\n\\nIn collecting these early flowers, one finds or fancies singular natural\\naffinities. I flatter myself with being able always to find hepatica, if\\nthere is any within reach, for I was brought up with it (\"Cockatoo\\nhe know me berry well\"); but other persons, who were brought up\\nwith May-flower, and remember searching for it with their almost\\nbaby-fingers, can find that better. The most remarkable instance\\nof these natural affinities was in the case of L.T. and his double\\nanemones. L. had always a gift for wild-flowers, and used often to bring\\nto Cambridge the largest white anemones that ever were seen, from a\\ncertain special hill in Watertown; they were not only magnificent in\\nsize and whiteness, but had that exquisite blue on the outside of\\nthe petals, as if the sky had bent down in ecstasy at last over its\\ndarlings, and left visible kisses there. But even this success was\\nnot enough, and one day he came with something yet choicer. It was a\\nrue-leaved anemone (_A. thalictraides_); and, if you will believe it,\\neach one of the three white flowers was _double,_ not merely with that\\nmultiplicity of petals in the disk which is common with this species,\\nbut technically and horticulturally double, like the double-flowering\\nalmond or cherry,--the most exquisitely delicate little petals, seeming\\nlike lace-work. He had three specimens,--gave one to the Autocrat of\\nBotany, who said it was almost or quite unexampled, and another to me.\\nAs the man in the fable says of the chameleon,--\"I have it yet, and can\\nproduce it.\"\\n\\nNow comes the marvel. The next winter L. went to New York for a year,\\nand wrote to me, as spring drew near, with solemn charge to visit his\\nfavorite haunt and find another specimen. Armed with this letter of\\nintroduction, I sought the spot, and tramped through and through its\\nleafy corridors. Beautiful wood-anemones I found, to be sure, trembling\\non their fragile stems, deserving all their pretty names,--Wind-flower,\\nEaster-flower, Pasque-flower, and homeopathic Pulsatilla; rue-leaved\\nanemones I found also, rising taller and straighter and firmer in stem,\\nwith the whorl of leaves a little higher up on the stalk than one\\nfancies it ought to be, as if there were a supposed danger that the\\nflowers would lose their balance, and as if the leaves must be all ready\\nto catch them. These I found, but the special wonder was not there for\\nme. Then I wrote to L. that he must evidently come himself and search;\\nor that, perhaps, as Sir Thomas Browne avers that \"smoke doth follow the\\nfairest,\" so his little treasures had followed him towards New York.\\nJudge of my surprise, when, on opening his next letter, out dropped,\\nfrom those folds of metropolitan paper, a veritable double anemone. He\\nhad just been out to Hoboken, or some such place, to spend an afternoon,\\nand, of course, his pets were there to meet him; and from that day to\\nthis, I have never heard of the thing happening to any one else.\\n\\nMay-Day is never allowed to pass in this community without profuse\\nlamentations over the tardiness of our spring as compared with that\\nof England and the poets. Yet it is very common to exaggerate this\\ndifference. Even so good an observer as Wilson Flagg is betrayed into\\nsaying that the epigaea and hepatica \"seldom make their appearance until\\nafter the middle of April\" in Massachusetts, and that \"it is not unusual\\nfor the whole month of April to pass away without producing more than\\ntwo or three species of wild-flowers.\" But I have formerly found the\\nhepatica in bloom at Mount Auburn, for three successive years, on the\\ntwenty-seventh of March; and last spring it was actually found, farther\\ninland, where the season is later, on the seventeenth. The May-flower is\\nusually as early, though the more gradual expansion of the buds renders\\nit less easy to give dates. And there are nearly twenty species which I\\nhave noted, for five or six years together, as found before May-Day, and\\nwhich may therefore be properly assigned to April. The list includes\\nbloodroot, cowslip, houstonia, saxifrage, dandelion, chickweed,\\ncinquefoil, strawberry, mouse-ear, bellwort, dog\\'s-tooth violet, five\\nspecies of violet proper, and two of anemone. These are all common\\nflowers, and easily observed; and the catalogue might be increased by\\nrare ones, as the white corydalis, the smaller yellow violet, (_V.\\nrotundifolia_,) and the claytonia or spring-beauty.\\n\\nBut in England the crocus and the snowdrop--neither being probably an\\nindigenous flower, since neither is mentioned by Chaucer--usually open\\nbefore the first of March; indeed, the snowdrop was formerly known by\\nthe yet more fanciful name of \"Fair Maid of February.\" Chaucer\\'s daisy\\ncomes equally early; and March brings daffodils, narcissi, violets,\\ndaisies, jonquils, hyacinths, and marsh-marigolds. This is altogether in\\nadvance of our season, so far as the flowers give evidence,--though we\\nhave plucked snowdrops in February. But, on the other hand, it would\\nappear, that, though a larger number of birds winter in England than in\\nMassachusetts, yet the return of those which migrate is actually earlier\\namong us. From journals kept during sixty years in England, and an\\nabstract of which is printed in Hone\\'s \"Every-Day Book,\" it appears that\\nonly two birds of passage revisit England before the fifteenth of April,\\nand only thirteen more before the first of May; while with us the\\nsong-sparrow and the bluebird appear about the first of March, and quite\\na number more by the middle of April. This is a peculiarity of the\\nEnglish spring which I have never seen explained or even mentioned.\\n\\nAfter the epigaea and the hepatica have opened, there is a slight pause\\namong the wild-flowers,--these two forming a distinct prologue for their\\nannual drama, as the brilliant witch-hazel in October brings up its\\nseparate epilogue. The truth is, Nature attitudinizes a little, liking\\nto make a neat finish with everything, and then to begin again with\\n_eclat_. Flowers seem spontaneous things enough, but there is evidently\\na secret marshalling among them, that all may be brought out with due\\neffect. As the country-people say that so long as any snow is left on\\nthe ground more snow may be expected, it must all vanish simultaneously\\nat last,--so every seeker of spring-flowers has observed how accurately\\nthey seem to move in platoons, with little straggling. Each species\\nseems to burst upon us with a united impulse; you may search for them\\nday after day in vain, but the day when you find one specimen the spell\\nis broken and you find twenty. By the end of April all the margins\\nof the great poem of the woods are illuminated with these exquisite\\nvignettes.\\n\\nMost of the early flowers either come before the full unfolding of their\\nleaves or else have inconspicuous ones. Yet Nature always provides for\\nher bouquets the due proportion of green. The verdant and graceful\\nsprays of the wild raspberry are unfolded very early, long before its\\ntime of flowering. Over the meadows spread the regular Chinese-pagodas\\nof the equisetum, (horsetail or scouring-rush,) and the rich coarse\\nvegetation of the veratrum, or American hellebore. In moist copses the\\nferns and osmundas begin to uncurl in April, opening their soft coils\\nof spongy verdure, coated with woolly down, from which the humming-bird\\nsteals the lining of her nest.\\n\\nThe early blossoms represent the aboriginal epoch of our history: the\\nblood-root and the May-flower are older than the white man, older\\nperchance than the red man; they alone are the true Native Americans. Of\\nthe later wild plants, many of the most common are foreign importations.\\nIn our sycophancy we attach grandeur to the name _exotic_: we call\\naristocratic garden-flowers by that epithet; yet they are no more exotic\\nthan the humbler companions they brought with them, which have become\\nnaturalized. The dandelion, the buttercup, duckweed, celandine, mullein,\\nburdock, yarrow, whiteweed, nightshade, and most of the thistles,--these\\nare importations. Miles Standish never crushed these with his heavy heel\\nas he strode forth to give battle to the savages; they never kissed the\\ndaintier foot of Priscilla, the Puritan maiden. It is noticeable that\\nthese are all of rather coarser texture than our indigenous flowers; the\\nchildren instinctively recognize this, and are apt to omit them, when\\ngathering the more delicate native blossoms of the woods.\\n\\nThere is something touching in the gradual retirement before\\ncivilization of these delicate aborigines. They do not wait for the\\nactual brute contact of red bricks and curbstones, but they feel the\\ndanger miles away. The Indians called the low plantain \"the white man\\'s\\nfootstep\"; and these shy creatures gradually disappear, the moment\\nthe red man gets beyond their hearing. Bigelow\\'s delightful \"Florula\\nBostoniensis\" is becoming a series of epitaphs. Too well we know it,--we\\nwho in happy Cambridge childhood often gathered, almost within a stone\\'s\\nthrow of Professor Agassiz\\'s new Museum, the arethusa and the gentian,\\nthe cardinal-flower and the gaudy rhexia,--we who remember the last\\nsecret hiding-place of the rhodora in West Cambridge, of the yellow\\nviolet and the _Viola debilis_ in Watertown, of the _Convallaria\\ntrifolia_ near Fresh Pond, of the _Hottonia_ beyond Wellington\\'s Hill,\\nof the _Cornus florida_ in West Roxbury, of the _Clintonia_ and the\\ndwarf ginseng in Brookline,--we who have found in its one chosen nook\\nthe sacred _Andromeda polyfolia_ of Linnaeus. Now vanished almost or\\nwholly from city-suburbs, these fragile creatures still linger in\\nmore rural parts of Massachusetts; but they are doomed everywhere,\\nunconsciously, yet irresistibly; while others still more shy, as the\\n_Linnoea_, the yellow _Cypripedium_, the early pink _Azalea_, and the\\ndelicate white _Corydalis_ or \"Dutchman\\'s breeches,\" are being chased\\ninto the very recesses of the Green and the White Mountains. The relics\\nof the Indian tribes are supported by the legislature at Martha\\'s\\nVineyard, while these precursors of the Indian are dying unfriended\\naway.\\n\\nAnd with these receding plants go also the special insects which haunt\\nthem. Who that knew that pure enthusiast, Dr. Harris, but remembers the\\naccustomed lamentations of the entomologist over the departure of these\\nwinged companions of his lifetime? Not the benevolent Mr. John Beeson\\nmore tenderly mourns the decay of the Indians than he the exodus of\\nthese more delicate native tribes. In a letter which I happened to\\nreceive from him a short time previous to his death, he thus renewed\\nthe lament:--\"I mourn for the loss of many of the beautiful plants\\nand insects that were once found in this vicinity. _Clethra, Rhodora,\\nSanguinaria, Viola debilis, Viola acuta, Dracoena borealis, Rhexia,\\nCypripedium, Corallorhiza verna, Orchis spectabilis_, with others of\\nless note, have been rooted out by the so-called hand of improvement.\\n_Cicindela rugifrons, Helluo proeusta, Sphoeroderus stenostomus,\\nBlethisa quadricollis, (Americana mi,) Carabus, Horia_, (which for\\nseveral years occurred in profusion on the sands beyond Mount Auburn,)\\nwith others, have entirely disappeared from their former haunts, driven\\naway, or exterminated perhaps, by the changes effected therein. There\\nmay still remain in your vicinity some sequestered spots, congenial\\nto these and other rarities, which may reward the botanist and the\\nentomologist who will search them carefully. Perhaps you may find there\\nthe pretty coccinella-shaped, silver-margined _Omophron_, or the still\\nrarer _Panagoeus fasciatus_, of which I once took two specimens on\\nWellington\\'s Hill, but have not seen it since.\" Is not this indeed\\nhandling one\\'s specimens \"gently as if you loved them,\" as Isaak Walton\\nbids the angler do with his worm?\\n\\nThere is this merit, at least, among the coarser crew of imported\\nflowers, that they bring their own proper names with them, and we know\\nprecisely whom we have to deal with. In speaking of our own native\\nflowers, we must either be careless and inaccurate, or else resort\\nsometimes to the Latin, in spite of the indignation of friends. There\\nis something yet to be said on this point. In England, where the old\\nhousehold and monkish names adhere, they are sufficient for popular\\nand poetic purposes, and the familiar use of scientific names seems an\\naffectation. But here, where many native flowers have no popular names\\nat all, and others are called confessedly by wrong ones,--where\\nit really costs less trouble to use Latin names than English, the\\naffectation seems the other way. Think of the long list of wild-flowers\\nwhere the Latin name is spontaneously used by all who speak of\\nthe flower: as, Arethusa, Aster, Cistus, (\"after the fall of the\\ncistus-flower,\") Clematis, Clethra, Geranium, Iris, Lobdia, Bhodora,\\nSpirtea, Tiarella, Trientalis, and so on. Even those formed from proper\\nnames (the worst possible system of nomenclature) become tolerable at\\nlast, and we forget the man in the more attractive flower. Are those\\nwho pick the Houstonia to be supposed thereby to indorse the Texan\\nPresident? Or are the deluded damsels who chew Cassia-buds to be\\nregarded as swallowing the late Secretary of State? The names have long\\nsince been made over to the flowers, and every questionable aroma has\\nvanished. When the godfather happens to be a botanist, there is a\\npeculiar fitness in the association; the Linaea, at least, would not\\nsmell so sweet by any other name.\\n\\nIn other cases the English name is a mere modification of the Latin\\none, and our ideal associations have really a scientific basis: as with\\nViolet, Lily, Laurel, Gentian, Vervain. Indeed, our enthusiasm for\\nvernacular names is like that for Indian names, one-sided: we enumerate\\nonly the graceful ones, and ignore the rest. It would be a pity to\\nLatinize Touch-me-not, or Yarrow, or Gold-Thread, or Self-Heal, or\\nColumbine, or Blue-Eyed-Grass,--though, to be sure, this last has an\\nannoying way of shutting up its azure orbs the moment you gather it, and\\nyou reach home with a bare, stiff blade, which deserves no better\\nname than _Sisyrinchium anceps._ But in what respect is Cucumber-Root\\npreferable to Medeola, or Solomon\\'s-Seal to Convallaria, or Rock-Tripe\\nto Umbilicaria, or Lousewort to Pedicularis? In other cases the merit\\nis divided: Anemone may dispute the prize of melody with Windflower,\\nCampanula with Harebell, Neottia with Ladies\\'-Tresses, Uvularia with\\nBellwort and Strawbell, Potentilla with Cinquefoil, and Sanguinaria with\\nBloodroot. Hepatica may be bad, but Liverleaf is worse. The pretty name\\nof May-flower is not so popular, after all, as that of Trailing-Arbutus,\\nwhere the graceful and appropriate adjective redeems the substantive,\\nwhich happens to be Latin and incorrect at the same time. It does seem a\\nwaste of time to say _Chrysanthemum leucanthemum_ instead of Whiteweed;\\nthough, if the long scientific name were an incantation to banish the\\nintruder, our farmers would gladly consent to adopt it.\\n\\nBut the great advantage of a reasonable use of the botanical name is,\\nthat it does not deceive us. Our primrose is not the English primrose,\\nany more than it was our robin who tucked up the babes in the wood;\\nour cowslip is not the English cowslip, it is the English\\nmarsh-marigold,--Tennyson\\'s \"wild marsh-marigold shines like fire in\\nswamps and hollows gray.\" The pretty name of Azalea means something\\ndefinite; but its rural name of Honeysuckle confounds under that name\\nflowers without even an external resemblance,--Azalea, Diervilla,\\nLonioera, Aquilegia,--just as every bird which sings loud in deep woods\\nis popularly denominated a thrush. The really rustic names of both\\nplants and animals are very few with us,--the different species are\\nmany; and as we come to know them better and love them more, we\\nabsolutely require some way to distinguish them from their half-sisters\\nand second-cousins. It is hopeless to try to create new popular\\nepithets, or even to revive those which are thoroughly obsolete. Miss\\nCooper may strive in vain, with benevolent intent, to christen her\\nfavorite spring-blossoms \"May-Wings\" and \"Gay-Wings,\" and \"Fringe-Cup\"\\nand \"Squirrel-Cup,\" and \"Cool-Wort\" and \"Bead-Ruby\"; there is no\\nconceivable reason why these should not be the familiar appellations,\\nexcept the irresistible fact that they are not. It is impossible to\\ncreate a popular name: one might as well attempt to invent a legend or\\ncompose a ballad. _Nascitur, non fit_.\\n\\nAs the spring comes on, and the densening outlines of the elm give daily\\na new design for a Grecian urn,--its hue, first brown with blossoms,\\nthen emerald with leaves,--we appreciate the vanishing beauty of the\\nbare boughs. In our favored temperate zone, the trees denude themselves\\neach year, like the goddesses before Paris, that we may see which\\nunadorned loveliness is the fairest. Only the unconquerable delicacy of\\nthe beech still keeps its soft vestments about it: far into spring, when\\nworn to thin rags and tatters, they cling there still; and when they\\nfall, the new appear as by magic. It must be owned, however, that the\\nbeech has good reasons for this prudishness, and possesses little beauty\\nof figure; while the elms, maples, chestnuts, walnuts, and even oaks,\\nhave not exhausted all their store of charms for us, until we have seen\\nthem disrobed. Only yonder magnificent pine-tree,--that pitch-pine,\\nnobler when seen in perfection than white-pine, or Norwegian, or Norfolk\\nIslander,--that pitch-pine, herself a grove, _una nemus_, holds her\\nunchanging beauty throughout the year, like her half-brother, the ocean,\\nwhose voice she shares; and only marks the flowing of her annual tide of\\nlife by the new verdure that yearly submerges all trace of last year\\'s\\nebb.\\n\\nHow many lessons of faith and beauty we should lose, if there were no\\nwinter in our year! Sometimes, in following up a watercourse among our\\nhills, in the early spring, one comes to a weird and desolate place,\\nwhere one huge wild grapevine has wreathed its ragged arms around a\\nwhole thicket and brought it to the ground,--swarming to the tops of\\nhemlocks, clenching a dozen young maples at once and tugging them\\ndownward, stretching its wizard black length across the underbrush, into\\nthe earth and out again, wrenching up great stones in its blind, aimless\\nstruggle. What a piece of chaos is this! Yet come here again, two months\\nhence, and you shall find all this desolation clothed with beauty\\nand with fragrance, one vast bower of soft green leaves and graceful\\ntendrils, while summer-birds chirp and flutter amid these sunny arches\\nall the livelong day. \"Out of the strong cometh forth sweetness.\"\\n\\nTo the end of April, and often later, one still finds remains of\\nsnowbanks in sheltered woods, especially those consisting of evergreen\\ntrees; and this snow, like that upon high mountains, has become hardened\\nby the repeated thawing and freezing of the surface, till it is more\\nimpenetrable than ice. But the snow that actually falls during April is\\nusually only what Vermonters call \"sugar-snow,\"--falling in the night\\nand just whitening the surface for an hour or two, and taking its name,\\nnot so much from its looks as from the fact that it denotes the\\nproper weather for \"sugaring,\" namely, cold nights and warm days. Our\\nsaccharine associations, however, remain so obstinately tropical, that\\nit seems almost impossible for the imagination to locate sugar in New\\nEngland trees; though it is known that not the maple only, but the birch\\nand the walnut even, afford it in appreciable quantities.\\n\\nAlong our maritime rivers the people associate April, not with\\n\"sugaring,\" but with \"shadding.\" The pretty _Amelanchier Canadensis_ of\\nGray--the _Aronia_ of Whittler\\'s song--is called Shad-bush or Shad-blow\\nin Essex County, from its connection with this season; and there is a\\nbird known as the Shad-spirit, which I take to be identical with the\\nflicker or golden-winged woodpecker, whose note is still held to\\nindicate the first day when the fish ascend the river. Upon such slender\\nwings flits our New England romance!\\n\\nIn April the creative process described by Thales is repeated, and the\\nworld is renewed by water. The submerged creatures first feel the touch\\nof spring, and many an equivocal career, beginning in the ponds and\\nbrooks, learns later to ignore this obscure beginning, and hops or\\nflutters in the dusty daylight. Early in March, before the first male\\ncanker-moth appears on the elm-tree, the whirlwig beetles have begun to\\nplay round the broken edges of the ice, and the caddis-worms to\\ncrawl beneath it; and soon come the water-skater _(Gerris)_ and the\\nwater-boatman _(Notonecta)_. Turtles and newts are in busy motion when\\nthe spring-birds are only just arriving. Those gelatinous masses in\\nyonder wayside-pond are the spawn of water-newts or tritons: in the\\nclear transparent jelly are imbedded, at regular intervals, little\\nblackish dots; these elongate rapidly, and show symptoms of head and\\ntail curled up in a spherical cell; the jelly is gradually absorbed for\\ntheir nourishment, until on some fine morning each elongated dot gives\\none vigorous wriggle, and claims thenceforward all the privileges\\nattendant on this dissolution of the union. The final privilege is often\\nthat of being suddenly snapped up by a turtle or a snake: for Nature\\nbrings forth her creatures liberally, especially the aquatic ones,\\nsacrifices nine-tenths of them as food for their larger cousins, and\\nreserves only a handful to propagate their race, on the same profuse\\nscale, next season.\\n\\nIt is surprising, in the midst of our Museums and Scientific Schools,\\nhow little we yet know of the common things before our eyes. Our\\n_savans_ still confess their inability to discriminate with certainty\\nthe egg or tadpole of a frog from that of a toad; and it is strange that\\nthese hopping creatures, which seem so unlike, should coincide so nearly\\nin their juvenile career, while the tritons and salamanders, which\\nborder so closely on each other in their maturer state as sometimes to\\nbe hardly distinguishable, yet choose different methods and different\\nelements for laying their eggs. The eggs of our salamanders or\\nland-lizards are deposited beneath the moss on some damp rock, without\\nany gelatinous envelope; they are but few in number, and the anxious\\nmamma may sometimes be found coiled in a circle around them, like the\\nsymbolic serpent of eternity.\\n\\nThe small number of birds yet present in early April gives a better\\nopportunity for careful study,--more especially if one goes armed with\\nthat best of fowling-pieces, a small spy-glass: the best,--since how\\nvalueless for purposes of observation is the bleeding, gasping, dying\\nbody, compared with the fresh and living creature, as it tilts,\\ntrembles, and warbles on the bough before you! Observe that robin in the\\noak-tree\\'s top: as he sits and sings, every one of the dozen different\\nnotes which he flings down to you is accompanied by a separate flirt and\\nflutter of his whole body, and, as Thoreau says of the squirrel, \"each\\nmovement seems to imply a spectator,\" and to imply, further, that the\\nspectator is looking through a spy-glass. Study that song-sparrow: why\\nis it that he always goes so ragged in spring, and the bluebird so\\nneat? is it that the song-sparrow is a wild artist, absorbed in the\\ncomposition of his lay, and oblivious of ordinary proprieties, while the\\nsmooth bluebird and his ash- mate cultivate their delicate warble\\nonly as a domestic accomplishment, and are always nicely dressed before\\nsitting down to the piano? Then how exciting is the gradual arrival of\\nthe birds in their summer-plumage! to watch it is as good as sitting at\\nthe window on Easter Sunday to observe the new bonnets. Yonder, in that\\nclump of alders by the brook, is the delicious jargoning of the first\\nflock of yellow-birds; there are the little gentlemen in black and\\nyellow, and the little ladies in olive-brown; \"sweet, sweet, sweet\" is\\nthe only word they say, and often they will so lower their ceaseless\\nwarble, that, though almost within reach, the little minstrels seem far\\naway. There is the very earliest cat-bird, mimicking the bobolink before\\nthe bobolink has come: what is the history of his song, then? is it a\\nreminiscence of last year? or has the little coquette been practising it\\nall winter, in some gay Southern society, where cat-birds and bobolinks\\ngrow intimate, just as Southern fashionables from different States\\nmay meet and sing duets at Saratoga? There sounds the sweet, low,\\nlong-continued trill of the little hair-bird, or chipping-sparrow, a\\nsuggestion of insect sounds in sultry summer, and produced, like them,\\nby a slight fluttering of the wings against the sides: by-and-by we\\nshall sometimes hear that same delicate rhythm burst the silence of the\\nJune midnights, and then, ceasing, make stillness more still. Now watch\\nthat woodpecker, roving in ceaseless search, travelling over fifty trees\\nin an hour, running from top to bottom of some small sycamore, pecking\\nat every crevice, pausing to dot a dozen inexplicable holes in a row\\nupon an apple-tree, but never once intermitting the low, querulous\\nmurmur of housekeeping anxiety: now she stops to hammer with all her\\nlittle life at some tough piece of bark, strikes harder and harder\\nblows, throws herself back at last, flapping her wings furiously as she\\nbrings down her whole strength again upon it; finally it yields, and\\ngrub after grub goes down her throat, till she whets her beak after the\\nmeal as a wild beast licks its claws, and off on her pressing business\\nonce more.\\n\\nIt is no wonder that there is so little substantial enjoyment of Nature\\nin the community, when we feed children on grammars and dictionaries\\nonly, and take no pains to train them to see that which is before\\ntheir eyes. The mass of the community have \"summered and wintered\" the\\nuniverse pretty regularly, one would think, for a good many years; and\\nyet nine persons out of ten in the town or city, and two out of three\\neven in the country, seriously suppose, for instance, that the buds upon\\ntrees are formed in the spring; they have had them before their eyes\\nall winter, and never seen them. As large a proportion suppose, in good\\nfaith, that a plant grows at the base of the stem, instead of at the\\ntop: that is, if they see a young sapling in which there is a crotch\\nat five feet from the ground, they expect to see it ten feet from the\\nground by-and-by,--confounding the growth of a tree with that of a man\\nor animal. But perhaps the best of us could hardly bear the severe test\\nunconsciously laid down by a small child of my acquaintance. The boy\\'s\\nfather, a college-bred man, had early chosen the better part, and\\nemployed his fine faculties in rearing laurels in his own beautiful\\nnursery-gardens, instead of in the more arid soil of court-rooms or\\nstate-houses. Of course the young human scion knew the flowers by name\\nbefore he knew his letters, and used their symbols more readily; and\\nafter he got the command of both, he was one day asked by his younger\\nbrother what the word _idiot_ meant,--for somebody in the parlor had\\nbeen saying that somebody else was an idiot. \"Don\\'t you know?\" quoth\\nBen, in his sweet voice: \"an idiot is a person who doesn\\'t know an\\narbor-vitae from a pine,--he doesn\\'t know anything.\" When Ben grows up\\nto maturity, bearing such terrible tests in his unshrinking hands, who\\nof us will be safe?\\n\\nThe softer aspects of Nature, especially, require time and culture\\nbefore man can enjoy them. To rude races her processes bring only\\nterror, which is very slowly outgrown. Humboldt has best exhibited the\\nscantiness of finer natural perceptions in Greek and Roman literature,\\nin spite of the grand oceanic anthology of Homer, and the delicate\\nwater-coloring of the Greek Anthology and of Horace. The Oriental and\\nthe Norse sacred books are full of fresh and beautiful allusions; but\\nthe Greek saw in Nature only a framework for Art, and the Roman only\\na camping-ground for men. Even Virgil describes the grotto of Aeneas\\nmerely as a \"black grove\" with \"horrid shade,\"--\"_Horrenti atrum\\nnemus imminet umbra_.\" Wordsworth points out, that, even in English\\nliterature, the \"Windsor Forest\" of Anne, Countess of Winchelsea, was\\nthe first poem which represented Nature as a thing to be consciously\\nenjoyed; and as she was almost the first English poetess, we might be\\ntempted to think that we owe this appreciation, like some other good\\nthings, to the participation of woman in literature. But, on the other\\nhand, it must be remembered that the voluminous Duchess of Newcastle, in\\nher \"Ode on Melancholy,\" describes among the symbols of hopeless gloom\\n\"the still moonshine night\" and \"a mill where rushing waters run\\nabout,\"--the sweetest natural images. So woman has not so much to claim,\\nafter all. In our own country, the early explorers seemed to find only\\nhorror in its woods and waterfalls. Josselyn, in 1672, could only\\ndescribe the summer splendor of the White Mountain region as \"dauntingly\\nterrible, being full of rocky hills, as thick as mole-hills in a meadow,\\nand full of infinite thick woods.\" Father Hennepin spoke of Niagara,\\nin the narrative still quoted in the guide-books, as a \"frightful\\ncataract\"; though perhaps his original French phrase was softer. And\\neven John Adams could find no better name than \"horrid chasm\" for the\\ngulf at Egg Rock, where he first saw the sea-anemone.\\n\\nBut we are lingering too long, perhaps, with this sweet April of smiles\\nand tears. It needs only to add that all her traditions are beautiful.\\nOvid says well, that she was not named from _aperire_, to open, as some\\nhave thought, but from _Aphrodite_, goddess of beauty. April holds\\nEaster-time, St. George\\'s Day, and the Eve of St. Mark\\'s. She has not,\\nlike her sister May in Germany, been transformed to a verb and made a\\nsynonyme for joy,--\"_Deine Seele maiet den trueben Herbst_\"--but April\\nwas believed in early ages to have been the birth-time of the world.\\nAccording to Venerable Bede, the point was first accurately determined\\nat a council held at Jerusalem about A.D. 200, when, after much profound\\ndiscussion, it was finally decided that the world\\'s birthday occurred on\\nSunday, April eighth,--that is, at the vernal equinox and the full moon.\\nBut April is certainly the birth-time of the year, at least, if not of\\nthe planet. Its festivals are older than Christianity, older than the\\nmemory of man. No sad associations cling to it, as to the month of June,\\nin which month, says William of Malmesbury, kings are wont to go to\\nwar,--\"_Quando solent reges ad arma procedere_,\"--but it holds the Holy\\nWeek, and it is the Holy Month. And in April Shakspeare was born, and in\\nApril he died.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE PROFESSOR\\'S STORY.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX.\\n\\nTHE WHITE ASH.\\n\\n\\nWhen Helen returned to Elsie\\'s bedside, it was with a new and still\\ndeeper feeling of sympathy, such as the story told by Old Sophy might\\nwell awaken. She understood, as never before, the singular fascination\\nand as singular repulsion which she had long felt in Elsie\\'s presence.\\nIt had not been without a great effort that she had forced herself to\\nbecome the almost constant attendant of the sick girl; and now she was\\nlearning, but not for the first time, the blessed truth which so many\\ngood women have found out for themselves, that the hardest duty bravely\\nperformed soon becomes a habit, and tends in due time to transform\\nitself into a pleasure.\\n\\nThe old Doctor was beginning to look graver, in spite of himself. The\\nfever, if such it was, went gently forward, wasting the young girl\\'s\\npowers of resistance from day to day; yet she showed no disposition\\nto take nourishment, and seemed literally to be living on air. It was\\nremarkable that with all this her look was almost natural, and her\\nfeatures were hardly sharpened so as to suggest that her life was\\nburning away. He did not like this, nor various other unobtrusive signs\\nof danger which his practised eye detected. A very small matter might\\nturn the balance which held life and death poised against each other.\\nHe surrounded her with precautions, that Nature might have every\\nopportunity of cunningly shifting the weights from the scale of death\\nto the scale of life, as she will often do, if not rudely disturbed or\\ninterfered with.\\n\\nLittle tokens of good-will and kind remembrance were constantly coming\\nto her from the girls in the school and the good people in the village.\\nSome of the mansion-house people obtained rare flowers which they sent\\nher, and her table was covered with fruits--which tempted her in vain.\\nSeveral of the school-girls wished to make her a basket of their own\\nhandiwork, and, filling it with autumnal flowers, to send it as a joint\\noffering. Mr. Bernard found out their project accidentally, and, wishing\\nto have his share in it, brought home from one of his long walks some\\nboughs full of variously tinted leaves, such as were still clinging\\nto the stricken trees. With these he brought also some of the already\\nfallen leaflets of the white ash, remarkable for their rich olive-purple\\ncolor, forming a beautiful contrast with some of the lighter-hued\\nleaves. It so happened that this particular tree, the white ash, did not\\ngrow upon The Mountain, and the leaflets were more welcome for their\\ncomparative rarity. So the girls made their basket, and the floor of it\\nthey covered with the rich olive-purple leaflets. Such late flowers as\\nthey could lay their hands upon served to fill it, and with many kindly\\nmessages they sent it to Miss Elsie Venner at the Dudley mansion-house.\\n\\nElsie was sitting up in her bed when it came, languid, but tranquil, and\\nHelen was by her, as usual, holding her hand, which was strangely cold,\\nHelen thought, for one who--was said to have some kind of fever. The\\nschool-girls\\' basket was brought in with its messages of love and hopes\\nfor speedy recovery. Old Sophy was delighted to see that it pleased\\nElsie, and laid it on the bed before her. Elsie began looking at the\\nflowers and taking them from the basket, that she might see the leaves.\\nAll at once she appeared to be agitated; she looked at the basket,--then\\naround, as if there were some fearful presence about her which she was\\nsearching for with her eager glances. She took out the flowers, one\\nby one, her breathing growing hurried, her eyes staring, her hands\\ntrembling,--till, as she came near the bottom of the basket, she flung\\nout all the rest with a hasty movement, looked upon the olive-purple\\nleaflets as if paralyzed for a moment, shrunk up, as it were, into\\nherself in a curdling terror, dashed the basket from her, and fell back\\nsenseless, with a faint cry which chilled the blood of the startled\\nlisteners at her bedside.\\n\\n\"Take it away!--take it away!--quick!\" said Old Sophy, as she hastened\\nto her mistress\\'s pillow. \"It\\'s the leaves of the tree that was always\\ndeath to her,--take it away! She can\\'t live wi\\' it in the room!\"\\n\\nThe poor old woman began chafing Elsie\\'s hands, and Helen to try to\\nrouse her with hartshorn, while a third frightened attendant gathered up\\nthe flowers and the basket and carried them out of the apartment. She\\ncame to herself after a time, but exhausted and then wandering. In her\\ndelirium, she talked constantly as if she were in a cave, with such\\nexactness of circumstance that Helen could not doubt at all that she had\\nsome such retreat among the rocks of The Mountain, probably fitted up in\\nher own fantastic way, where she sometimes hid herself from all human\\neyes, and of the entrance to which she alone possessed the secret.\\n\\nAll this passed away, and left her, of course, weaker than before. But\\nthis was not the only influence the unexplained paroxysm had left behind\\nit. From this time forward there was a change in her whole expression\\nand her manner. The shadows ceased flitting over her features, and the\\nold woman, who watched her from day to day and from hour to hour as a\\nmother watches her child, saw the likeness she bore to her mother coming\\nforth more and more, as the cold glitter died out of the diamond eyes,\\nand the scowl disappeared from the dark brows and low forehead.\\n\\nWith all the kindness and indulgence her father had bestowed upon her,\\nElsie had never felt that he loved her. The reader knows well enough\\nwhat fatal recollections and associations had frozen up the springs of\\nnatural affection in his breast. There was nothing in the world he would\\nnot do for Elsie. He had sacrificed his whole life to her. His very\\nseeming carelessness about restraining her was all calculated; he knew\\nthat restraint would produce nothing but utter alienation. Just so\\nfar as she allowed him, he shared her studies, her few pleasures, her\\nthoughts; but she was essentially solitary and uncommunicative. No\\nperson, as was said long ago, could judge him,--because his task was not\\nmerely difficult, but simply impracticable to human powers. A nature\\nlike Elsie\\'s had necessarily to be studied by itself, and to be followed\\nin its laws where it could not be led.\\n\\nEvery day, at different hours, during the whole of his daughter\\'s\\nillness, Dudley Venner had sat by her, doing all he could to soothe and\\nplease her: always the same thin film of some emotional non-conductor\\nbetween them; always that kind of habitual regard and family-interest,\\nmingled with the deepest pity on one side and a sort of respect on the\\nother, which never warmed into outward evidences of affection.\\n\\nIt was after this occasion, when she had been so profoundly agitated\\nby a seemingly insignificant cause, that her father and Old Sophy were\\nsitting, one at one side of her bed and one at the other. She had fallen\\ninto a light slumber. As they were looking at her, the same thought came\\ninto both their minds at the same moment. Old Sophy spoke for both, as\\nshe said, in a low voice,--\\n\\n\"It\\'s her mother\\'s look,--it\\'s her mother\\'s own face right over\\nagain,--she never look\\' so before,--the Lord\\'s hand is on her! His will\\nbe done!\"\\n\\nWhen Elsie woke and lifted her languid eyes upon her father\\'s face, she\\nsaw in it a tenderness, a depth of affection, such as she remembered\\nat rare moments of her childhood, when she had won him to her by some\\nunusual gleam of sunshine in her fitful temper.\\n\\n\"Elsie, dear,\" he said, \"we were thinking how much your expression was\\nsometimes like that of your sweet mother. If you could but have seen\\nher, so as to remember her!\"\\n\\nThe tender look and tone, the yearning of the daughter\\'s heart for the\\nmother she had never seen, save only with the unfixed, undistinguishing\\neyes of earliest infancy, perhaps the under-thought that she might soon\\nrejoin her in another state of being,--all came upon her with a sudden\\noverflow of feeling which broke through all the barriers between her\\nheart and her eyes, and Elsie wept. It seemed to her father as if the\\nmalign influence,--evil spirit it might almost be called,--which had\\npervaded her being, had at last been driven forth or exorcised, and that\\nthese tears were at once the sign and the pledge of her redeemed nature.\\nBut now she was to be soothed, and not excited. After her tears she\\nslept again, and the look her face wore was peaceful as never before.\\n\\nOld Sophy met the Doctor at the door and told him all the circumstances\\nconnected with the extraordinary attack from which Elsie had suffered.\\nIt was the purple leaves, she said. She remembered that Dick once\\nbrought home a branch of a tree with some of the same leaves on it, and\\nElsie screamed and almost fainted then. She, Sophy, had asked her, after\\nshe had got quiet, what it was in the leaves that made her feel so bad.\\nElsie couldn\\'t tell her,--didn\\'t like to speak about it,--shuddered\\nwhenever Sophy mentioned it.\\n\\nThis did not sound so strangely to the old Doctor as it does to some\\nwho listen to this narrative. He had known some curious examples of\\nantipathies, and remembered reading of others still more singular.\\nHe had known those who could not bear the presence of a cat, and\\nrecollected the story, often told, of a person\\'s hiding one in a chest\\nwhen one of these sensitive individuals came into the room, so as not to\\ndisturb him; but he presently began to sweat and turn pale, and cried\\nout that there must be a cat hid somewhere. He knew people who were\\npoisoned by strawberries, by honey, by different meats,--many who could\\nnot endure cheese,--some who could not bear the smell of roses. If he\\nhad known all the stories in the old books, he would have found that\\nsome have swooned and become as dead men at the smell of a rose,--that\\na stout soldier has been known to turn and run at the sight or smell of\\nrue,--that cassia and even olive-oil have produced deadly faintings in\\ncertain individuals,--in short, that almost everything has seemed to be\\na poison to somebody.\\n\\n\"Bring me that basket, Sophy,\" said the old Doctor, \"if you can find\\nit.\"\\n\\nSophy brought it to him,--for he had not yet entered Elsie\\'s apartment.\\n\\n\"These purple leaves are from the white ash,\" he said. \"You don\\'t know\\nthe notion that people commonly have about that tree, Sophy?\"\\n\\n\"I know they say the Ugly Things never go where the white ash grows,\"\\nSophy answered. \"Oh, Doctor dear, what I\\'m thinkin\\' of a\\'n\\'t true, is\\nit?\"\\n\\nThe Doctor smiled sadly, but did not answer. He went directly to Elsie\\'s\\nroom. Nobody would have known by his manner that he saw any special\\nchange in his patient. He spoke with her as usual, made some slight\\nalteration in his prescriptions, and left the room with a kind, cheerful\\nlook. He met her father on the stairs.\\n\\n\"Is it as I thought?\" said Dudley Venner.\\n\\n\"There is everything to fear,\" the Doctor said, \"and not much, I am\\nafraid, to hope. Does not her face recall to you one that you remember,\\nas never before?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" her father answered,--\"oh, yes! What is the meaning of this\\nchange which has come over her features, and her voice, her temper, her\\nwhole being? Tell me, oh, tell me, what is it? Can it be that the curse\\nis passing away, and my daughter is to be restored to me,--such as her\\nmother would have had her,--such as her mother was?\"\\n\\n\"Walk out with me into the garden,\" the Doctor said, \"and I will tell\\nyou all I know and all I think about this great mystery of Elsie\\'s\\nlife.\"\\n\\nThey walked out together, and the Doctor began:--\\n\\n\"She has lived a twofold being, as it were,--the consequence of the\\nblight which fell upon her in the dim period before consciousness. You\\ncan see what she might have been but for this. You know that for these\\neighteen years her whole existence has taken its character from that\\ninfluence which we need not name. But you will remember that few of the\\nlower forms of life last as human beings do; and thus it might have been\\nhoped and trusted with some show of reason, as I have always suspected\\nyou hoped and trusted, perhaps more confidently than myself, that the\\nlower nature which had become ingrafted on the higher would die out and\\nleave the real woman\\'s life she inherited to outlive this accidental\\nprinciple which had so poisoned her childhood and youth. I believe it\\nis so dying out; but I am afraid,--yes, I must say it, I fear it has\\ninvolved the centres of life in its own decay. There is hardly any pulse\\nat Elsie\\'s wrist; no stimulants seem to rouse her; and it looks as if\\nlife were slowly retreating inwards, so that by-and-by she will sleep as\\nthose who lie down in the cold and never wake.\"\\n\\nStrange as it may seem, her father heard all this not without deep\\nsorrow, and such marks of it as his thoughtful and tranquil nature, long\\nschooled by suffering, claimed or permitted, but with a resignation\\nitself the measure of his past trials. Dear as his daughter might become\\nto him, all he dared to ask of Heaven was that she might be restored to\\nthat truer self which lay beneath her false and adventitious being. If\\nhe could once see that the icy lustre in her eyes had become a soft,\\ncalm light,--that her soul was at peace with all about her and with Him\\nabove,--this crumb from the children\\'s table was enough for him, as it\\nwas for the Syro-Phoenician woman who asked that the dark spirit might\\ngo out from her daughter.\\n\\nThere was little change the next day, until all at once she said in a\\nclear voice that she should like to see her master at the school,\\nMr. Langdon. He came accordingly, and took the place of Helen at her\\nbedside. It seemed as if Elsie had forgotten the last scene with him.\\nMight it be that pride had come in, and she had sent for him only to\\nshow how superior she had grown to the weakness which had betrayed her\\ninto that extraordinary request, so contrary to the instincts and usages\\nof her sex? Or was it that the singular change which had come over her\\nhad involved her passionate fancy for him and swept it away with her\\nother habits of thought and feeling? Or perhaps, rather, that she felt\\nthat all earthly interests were becoming of little account to her, and\\nwished to place herself right with one to whom she had displayed a\\nwayward movement of her unbalanced imagination? She welcomed Mr.\\nBernard as quietly as she had received Helen Darley. He  at the\\nrecollection of that last scene, when he came into her presence; but\\nshe smiled with perfect tranquillity. She did not speak to him of any\\napprehension; but he saw that she looked upon herself as doomed. So\\nfriendly, yet so calm did she seem through all their interview, that Mr.\\nBernard could only look back upon her manifestation of feeling towards\\nhim on their walk from the school as a vagary of a mind laboring\\nunder some unnatural excitement, and wholly at variance with the true\\ncharacter of Elsie Venner, as he saw her before him in her subdued,\\nyet singular beauty. He looked with almost scientific closeness of\\nobservation into the diamond eyes; but that peculiar light which he knew\\nso well was not there. She was the same in one sense as on that first\\nday when he had seen her coiling and uncoiling her golden chain, yet how\\ndifferent in every aspect which revealed her state of mind and emotion!\\nSomething of tenderness there was, perhaps, in her tone towards him;\\nshe would not have sent for him, had she not felt more than an ordinary\\ninterest in him. But through the whole of his visit she never lost her\\ngracious self-possession. The Dudley race might well be proud of the\\nlast of its daughters, as she lay dying, but unconquered by the feeling\\nof the present or the fear of the future.\\n\\nAs for Mr. Bernard, he found it very hard to look upon her and listen to\\nher unmoved. There was nothing that reminded him of the stormy-browed,\\nalmost savage girl he remembered in her fierce loveliness,--nothing of\\nall her singularities of air and of costume. Nothing? Yes, one thing.\\nWeak and suffering as she was, she had never parted with one particular\\nornament, such as a sick person would naturally, as it might be\\nsupposed, get rid of at once. The golden cord which she wore round her\\nneck at the great party was still there. A bracelet was lying by her\\npillow; she had unclasped it from her wrist.\\n\\nBefore Mr. Bernard left her, she said,--\"I shall never see you again.\\nSome time or other, perhaps, you will mention my name to one whom you\\nlove. Give her this from your scholar and friend Elsie.\"\\n\\nHe took the bracelet, raised her hand to his lips, then turned his face\\naway; in that moment he was the weaker of the two.\\n\\n\"Good-bye,\" she said; \"thank you for coming.\"\\n\\nHis voice died away in his throat, as he tried to answer her. She\\nfollowed him with her eyes as he passed from her sight through the door,\\nand when it closed after him sobbed tremulously once or twice,--but\\nstilled herself, and met Helen, as she entered, with a composed\\ncountenance.\\n\\n\"I have had a very pleasant visit from Mr. Langdon,\" Elsie said. \"Sit\\nby me, Helen, awhile without speaking; I should like to sleep, if I\\ncan,--and to dream.\"\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXX.\\n\\nTHE GOLDEN CORD IS LOOSED.\\n\\n\\nThe Reverend Chauncy Fairweather, hearing that his parishioner\\'s\\ndaughter, Elsie, was very ill, could do nothing less than come to the\\nmansion-house and tender such consolations as he was master of. It was\\nrather remarkable that the old Doctor did not exactly approve of his\\nvisit. He thought that company of every sort might be injurious in her\\nweak state. He was of opinion that Mr. Fairweather, though greatly\\ninterested in religious matters, was not the most sympathetic person\\nthat could be found; in fact, the old Doctor thought he was too much\\ntaken up with his own interests for eternity to give himself quite so\\nheartily to the need of other people as some persons got up on a rather\\nmore generous scale (our good neighbor Dr. Honeywood, for instance)\\ncould do. However, all these things had better be arranged to suit her\\nwants; if she would like to talk with a clergyman, she had a great\\ndeal better see one as often as she liked, and run the risk of the\\nexcitement, than have a hidden wish for such a visit and perhaps find\\nherself too weak to see him by-and-by.\\n\\nThe old Doctor knew by sad experience that dreadful mistake against\\nwhich all medical practitioners should be warned. His experience may\\nwell be a guide for others. Do not overlook the desire for spiritual\\nadvice and consolation which patients sometimes feel, and, with the\\nfrightful _mauvaise honte_ peculiar to Protestantism, alone among all\\nhuman beliefs, are ashamed to tell. As a part of medical treatment, it\\nis the physician\\'s business to detect the hidden longing for the food of\\nthe soul, as much as for any form of bodily nourishment. Especially in\\nthe higher walks of society, where this unutterably miserable false\\nshame of Protestantism acts in proportion to the general acuteness of\\nthe cultivated sensibilities, let no unwillingness to suggest the sick\\nperson\\'s real need suffer him to languish between his want and his\\nmorbid sensitiveness. What an infinite advantage the Mussulmans and the\\nCatholics have over many of our more exclusively spiritual sects in the\\nway they keep their religion always by them and never blush for it! And\\nbesides this spiritual longing, we should never forget that\\n\\n  \"On some fond breast the parting soul relies,\"\\n\\nand the minister of religion, in addition to the sympathetic nature\\nwhich we have a right to demand in him, has trained himself to the art\\nof entering into the feelings of others.\\n\\nThe reader must pardon this digression, which introduces the visit of\\nthe Reverend Chauncy Fairweather to Elsie Venner. It was mentioned\\nto her that he would like to call and see how she was, and she\\nconsented,--not with much apparent interest, for she had reasons of her\\nown for not feeling any very deep conviction of his sympathy for persons\\nin sorrow. But he came, and worked the conversation round to religion,\\nand confused her with his hybrid notions, half made up of what he had\\nbeen believing and teaching all his life, and half of the new doctrines\\nwhich he had veneered upon the surface of his old belief. He got so\\nfar as to make a prayer with her,--a cool, well-guarded prayer, which\\ncompromised his faith as little as possible, and which, if devotion were\\na game played against Providence, might have been considered a cautious\\nand sagacious move.\\n\\nWhen he had gone, Elsie called Old Sophy to her.\\n\\n\"Sophy,\" she said, \"don\\'t let them send that cold-hearted man to me any\\nmore. If your old minister comes to see you, I should like to hear him\\ntalk. He looks as if he cared for everybody, and would care for me. And,\\nSophy, if I should die one of these days, I should like to have that old\\nminister come and say whatever is to be said over me. It would comfort\\nDudley more, I know, than to have that hard man here, when you\\'re in\\ntrouble: for some of you will be sorry when I\\'m gone,--won\\'t you,\\nSophy?\"\\n\\nThe poor old black woman could not stand this question. The cold\\nminister had frozen Elsie until she felt as if nobody cared for her or\\nwould regret her,--and her question had betrayed this momentary feeling.\\n\\n\"Don\\' talk so! don\\' talk so, darlin\\'!\" she cried, passionately. \"When\\nyou go, Ol\\' Sophy\\'ll go; \\'n\\' where you go, Ol\\' Sophy\\'ll go: \\'n\\' we\\'ll\\nboth go t\\' th\\' place where th\\' Lord takes care of all his children,\\nwhether their faces are white or black. Oh, darlin\\', darlin\\'! if th\\'\\nLord should let me die fus\\', you shall fin\\' all ready for you when you\\ncome after me. On\\'y don\\' go \\'n\\' leave poor Ol\\' Sophy all \\'lone in th\\'\\nworld!\"\\n\\nHelen came in at this moment and quieted the old woman with a look. Such\\nscenes were just what were most dangerous, in the state in which Elsie\\nwas lying: but that is one of the ways in which an affectionate friend\\nsometimes unconsciously wears out the life which a hired nurse, thinking\\nof nothing but her regular duties and her wages, would have spared from\\nall emotional fatigue.\\n\\nThe change which had come over Elsie\\'s disposition was itself the cause\\nof new excitements. How was it possible that her father could keep away\\nfrom her, now that she was coming back to the nature and the very look\\nof her mother, the bride of his youth? How was it possible to refuse\\nher, when she said to Old Sophy that she should like to have her\\nminister come in and sit by her, even though his presence might perhaps\\nprove a new source of excitement?\\n\\nBut the Reverend Doctor did come and sit by her, and spoke such soothing\\nwords to her, words of such peace and consolation, that from that hour\\nshe was tranquil as never before. All true hearts are alike in the\\nhour of need; the Catholic has a reserved fund of faith for his\\nfellow-creature\\'s trying moment, and the Calvinist reread those springs\\nof human brotherhood and chanty in his soul which are only covered over\\nby the iron tables inscribed with the harder dogmas of his creed. It was\\nenough that the Reverend Doctor knew all Elsie\\'s history. He could not\\njudge her by any formula, like those which have been moulded by past\\nages out of their ignorance. He did not talk with her as if she were an\\noutside sinner, worse than himself. He found a bruised and languishing\\nsoul, and bound up its wounds. A blessed office,--one which is confined\\nto no sect or creed, but which good men in all times, under various\\nnames and with varying ministries, to suit the need of each age, of each\\nrace, of each individual soul, have come forward to discharge for their\\nsuffering fellow-creatures.\\n\\nAfter this there was little change in Elsie, except that her heart beat\\nmore feebly every day,--so that the old Doctor himself, with all his\\nexperience, could see nothing to account for the gradual failing of the\\npowers of life, and yet could find no remedy which seemed to arrest its\\nprogress in the smallest degree.\\n\\n\"Be very careful,\" he said, \"that she is not allowed to make any\\nmuscular exertion. Any such effort, when a person is so enfeebled, may\\nstop the heart in a moment; and if it stops, it will never move again.\"\\n\\nHelen enforced this rule with the greatest care. Elsie was hardly\\nallowed to move her hand or to speak above a whisper. It seemed to be\\nmainly the question now, whether this trembling flame of life would be\\nblown out by some light breath of air, or whether it could be so nursed\\nand sheltered by the hollow of these watchful hands that it would have a\\nchance to kindle to its natural brightness.\\n\\n--Her father came in to sit with her in the evening. He had never talked\\nso freely with her as during the hour he had passed at her bedside,\\ntelling her little circumstances of her mother\\'s life, living over with\\nher all that was pleasant in the past, and trying to encourage her with\\nsome cheerful gleams of hope for the future. A faint smile played over\\nher face, but she did not answer his encouraging suggestions. The hour\\ncame for him to leave her with those who watched by her.\\n\\n\"Good-night, my dear child,\" he said, and, stooping down, kissed her\\ncheek.\\n\\nElsie rose by a sudden effort, threw her arms round his neck, kissed\\nhim, and said, \"Good-night, my dear father!\"\\n\\nThe suddenness of her movement had taken him by surprise, or he would\\nhave checked so dangerous an effort. It was too late now. Her arms\\nslid away from him like lifeless weights,--her head fell back upon her\\npillow,--a long sigh breathed through her lips.\\n\\n\"She is faint,\" said Helen, doubtfully; \"bring me the hartshorn, Sophy.\"\\n\\nThe old woman had started from her place, and was now leaning over her,\\nlooking in her face, and listening for the sound of her breathing.\\n\\n\"She\\'s dead! Elsie\\'s dead! My darlin\\' \\'s dead!\" she cried aloud, filling\\nthe room with her utterance of anguish.\\n\\nDudley Venner drew her away and silenced her with a voice of authority,\\nwhile Helen and an assistant plied their restoratives. It was all in\\nvain.\\n\\nThe solemn tidings passed from the chamber of death through the family.\\nThe daughter, the hope of that old and honored house, was dead in the\\nfreshness of her youth, and the home of its solitary representative was\\nhereafter doubly desolate.\\n\\nA messenger rode hastily out of the avenue. A little after this the\\npeople of the village and the outlying farm-houses were startled by the\\nsound of a bell.\\n\\nOne,--two,--three,--four,--\\n\\nThey stopped in every house, as far as the wavering vibrations reached,\\nand listened--\\n\\n--five,--six,--seven,--\\n\\nIt was not the little child which had been lying so long at the point of\\ndeath; that could not be more than three or four years old--\\n\\n--eight,--nine,--ten,--and so on to\\nfifteen,--sixteen,--seventeen,--eighteen----\\n\\nThe pulsations seemed to keep on,--but it was the brain, and not the\\nbell, that was throbbing now.\\n\\n\"Elsie\\'s dead!\" was the exclamation at a hundred firesides.\\n\\n\"Eighteen year old,\" said old Widow Peake, rising from her chair.\\n\"Eighteen year ago I laid two gold eagles on her mother\\'s eyes,--he\\nwouldn\\'t have anything but gold touch her eyelids,--and now Elsie\\'s to\\nbe straightened,--the Lord have mercy on her poor sinful soul!\"\\n\\nDudley Venner prayed that night that he might be forgiven, if he had\\nfailed in any act of duty or kindness to this unfortunate child of his,\\nnow freed from all the woes born with her and so long poisoning her\\nsoul. He thanked God for the brief interval of peace which had been\\ngranted her, for the sweet communion they had enjoyed in these last\\ndays, and for the hope of meeting her with that other lost friend in a\\nbetter world.\\n\\nHelen mingled a few broken thanks and petitions with her tears: thanks\\nthat she had been permitted to share the last days and hours of this\\npoor sister in sorrow; petitions that the grief of bereavement might be\\nlightened to the lonely parent and the faithful old servant.\\n\\nOld Sophy said almost nothing, but sat day and night by her dead\\ndarling. But sometimes her anguish would find an outlet in strange\\nsounds, something between a cry and a musical note,--such as none had\\never heard her utter before. These were old remembrances surging up from\\nher childish days,--coming through her mother from the cannibal chief,\\nher grandfather,--death-wails, such as they sing in the mountains of\\nWestern Africa, when they see the fires on distant hill-sides and know\\nthat their own wives and children are undergoing the fate of captives.\\n\\nThe time came when Elsie was to be laid by her mother in the small\\nsquare marked by the white stone.\\n\\nIt was not unwillingly that the Reverend Chauncy Fairweather had\\nrelinquished the duty of conducting the service to the Reverend Doctor\\nHoneywood, in accordance with Elsie\\'s request. He could not, by any\\nreasoning, reconcile his present way of thinking with a hope for the\\nfuture of his unfortunate parishioner. Any good old Roman Catholic\\npriest, born and bred to his faith and his business, would have found a\\nloop-hole into some kind of heaven for her, by virtue of his doctrine of\\n\"invincible ignorance,\" or other special proviso; but a recent convert\\ncannot enter into the working conditions of his new creed. Beliefs must\\nbe lived in for a good while, before they accommodate themselves to the\\nsoul\\'s wants, and wear loose enough to be comfortable.\\n\\nThe Reverend Doctor had no such scruples. Like thousands of those who\\nare classed nominally with the despairing believers, he had never prayed\\nover a departed brother or sister without feeling and expressing a\\nguarded hope that there was mercy in store for the poor sinner, whom\\nparents, wives, children, brothers and sisters could not bear to give up\\nto utter ruin without a word,--and would not, as he knew full well,\\nin virtue of that human love and sympathy which nothing can ever\\nextinguish. And in this poor Elsie\\'s history he could read nothing\\nwhich the tears of the recording angel might not wash away. As the good\\nphysician of the place knew the diseases that assailed the bodies of men\\nand women, so he had learned the mysteries of the sickness of the soul.\\n\\nSo many wished to look upon Elsie\\'s face once more, that her father\\nwould not deny them; nay, he was pleased that those who remembered her\\nliving should see her in the still beauty of death. Helen and those with\\nher arrayed her for this farewell-view. All was ready for the sad or\\ncurious eyes which were to look upon her. There was no painful change to\\nbe concealed by any artifice. Even her round neck was left uncovered,\\nthat she might be more like one who slept. Only the golden cord was left\\nin its place: some searching eye might detect a trace of that birth-mark\\nwhich it was whispered she had always worn a necklace to conceal.\\n\\nAt the last moment, when all the preparations were completed, Old Sophy\\nstooped over her, and, with trembling hand, loosed the golden cord. She\\nlooked intently, for some little space: there was no shade nor blemish\\nwhere the ring of gold had encircled her throat. She took it gently away\\nand laid it in the casket which held her ornaments.\\n\\n\"The Lord be praised!\" the old woman cried, aloud. \"He has taken away\\nthe mark that was on her; she\\'s fit to meet his holy angels now!\"\\n\\nSo Elsie lay for hours in the great room, in a kind of state, with\\nflowers all about her,--her black hair braided, as in life,--her\\nbrows smooth, as if they had never known the scowl of passion,--and\\non her lips the faint smile with which she had uttered her last\\n\"Good-night.\" The young girls from the school looked at her, one after\\nanother, and passed on, sobbing, carrying in their hearts the picture\\nthat would be with them all their days. The great people of the place\\nwere all there with their silent sympathy. The lesser kind of gentry,\\nand many of the plainer folk of the village, half-pleased to find\\nthemselves passing beneath the stately portico of the ancient\\nmansion-house, crowded in, until the ample rooms were overflowing. All\\nthe friends whose acquaintance we have made were there, and many from\\nremoter villages and towns.\\n\\nThere was a deep silence at last. The hour had come for the parting\\nwords to be spoken over the dead. The good old minister\\'s voice rose out\\nof the stillness, subdued and tremulous at first, but growing firmer and\\nclearer as he went on, until it reached the ears of the visitors who\\nwere in the far, desolate chambers, looking at the pictured hangings and\\nthe old dusty portraits. He did not tell her story in his prayer. He\\nonly spoke of our dear departed sister as one of many whom Providence in\\nits wisdom has seen fit to bring under bondage from their cradles. It\\nwas not for us to judge them by any standard of our own. He who made the\\nheart alone knew the infirmities it inherited or acquired. For all that\\nour dear sister had presented that was interesting and attractive in her\\ncharacter we were to be grateful; for whatever was dark or inexplicable\\nwe must trust that the deep shadow which rested on the twilight dawn of\\nher being might render a reason before the bar of Omniscience; for the\\ngrace which had lightened her last days we should pour out our hearts in\\nthankful acknowledgment. From the life and the death of this our dear\\nsister we should learn a lesson of patience with our fellow-creatures in\\ntheir inborn peculiarities, of charity in judging what seem to us wilful\\nfaults of character, of hope and trust, that, by sickness or affliction,\\nor such inevitable discipline as life must always bring with it, if by\\nno gentler means, the soul which had been left by Nature to wander into\\nthe path of error and of suffering might be reclaimed and restored to\\nits true aim, and so led on by divine grace to its eternal welfare. He\\nclosed his prayer by commending each member of the afflicted family to\\nthe divine blessing.\\n\\nThen all at once rose the clear sound of the girls\\' voices, in the\\nsweet, sad melody of a funeral hymn,--one of those which Elsie had\\nmarked, as if prophetically, among her own favorites.\\n\\nAnd so they laid her in the earth, and showered down flowers upon her,\\nand filled her grave, and covered it with green sods. By the side of it\\nwas another oblong ridge, with a white stone standing at its head. Mr.\\nBernard looked upon it, as he came close to the place where Elsie was\\nlaid, and read the inscription,--\\n\\n  CATALINA\\n\\n  WIFE TO DUDLEY VENNER\\n\\n  DIED\\n\\n  OCTOBER 13TH 1840\\n\\n  AGED XX YEARS.\\n\\nA gentle rain fell on the turf after it was laid. This was the beginning\\nof a long and dreary autumnal storm, a deferred \"equinoctial,\" as many\\nconsidered it. The mountain-streams were all swollen and turbulent, and\\nthe steep declivities were furrowed in every direction by new channels.\\nIt made the house seem doubly desolate to hear the wind howling and the\\nrain beating upon the roofs. The poor relation who was staying at the\\nhouse would insist on Helen\\'s remaining a few days: Old Sophy was in\\nsuch a condition, that it kept her in continual anxiety and there were\\nmany cares which Helen could take off from her.\\n\\nThe old black woman\\'s life was buried in her darling\\'s grave. She did\\nnothing but moan and lament for her. At night she was restless, and\\nwould get up and wander to Elsie\\'s apartment and look for her and call\\nher by name. At other times she would lie awake and listen to the wind\\nand the rain,--sometimes with such a wild look upon her face, and with\\nsuch sudden starts and exclamations, that it seemed, as if she heard\\nspirit-voices and were answering the whispers of unseen visitants. With\\nall this were mingled hints of her old superstition,--forebodings of\\nsomething fearful about to happen,--perhaps the great final catastrophe\\nof all things, according to the prediction current in the kitchens of\\nRockland.\\n\\n\"Hark!\" Old Sophy would say,--\"don\\' you hear th\\' crackin\\' \\'n\\' th\\'\\nsnappin\\' up in \\'Th\\' Mountain, \\'n\\' th\\' rollin\\' o\\' th\\' big stones? The\\' \\'s\\nsomethin\\' stirrin\\' among th\\' rocks; I hear th\\' soun\\' of it in th\\' night,\\nwhen th\\' wind has stopped blowin\\'. Oh, stay by me a little while, Miss\\nDarlin\\'! stay by me! for it\\'s th\\' Las\\' Day, may be, that\\'s close on us,\\n\\'n\\' I feel as if I couldn\\' meet th\\' Lord all alone!\"\\n\\nIt was curious,--but Helen did certainly recognize sounds, during the\\nlull of the storm, which were not of falling rain or running streams,\\n--short snapping sounds, as of tense cords breaking,--long uneven\\nsounds, as of masses rolling down steep declivities. But the morning\\ncame as usual; and as the others said nothing of these singular noises,\\nHelen did not think it necessary to speak of them. All day long she\\nand the humble relative of Elsie\\'s mother, who had appeared, as poor\\nrelations are wont to in the great crises of life, were busy in\\narranging the disordered house, and looking over the various objects\\nwhich Elsie\\'s singular tastes had brought together, to dispose of them\\nas her father might direct. They all met together at the usual hour for\\ntea. One of the servants came in, looking very blank, and said to the\\npoor relation,--\\n\\n\"The well is gone dry; we have nothing but rain-water.\"\\n\\nDudley Venner\\'s countenance changed; he sprang to his feet and went to\\nassure himself of the fact, and, if he could, of the reason of it. For\\na well to dry up during such a rain-storm was extraordinary,--it was\\nominous.\\n\\nHe came back, looking very anxious.\\n\\n\"Did any of you notice any remarkable sounds last night,\" he said,--\\n\"or this morning? Hark! do you hear anything now?\"\\n\\nThey listened in perfect silence for a few moments. Then there came a\\nshort cracking sound, and two or three snaps, as of parting cords.\\n\\nDudley Venner called all his household together.\\n\\n\"We are in danger here, as I think, to-night,\" he said,--\"not very\\ngreat danger, perhaps, but it is a risk I do not wish you to run. These\\nheavy rains have loosed some of the rocks above, and they may come down\\nand endanger the house. Harness the horses, Elbridge, and take all the\\nfamily away. Miss Darley will go to the Institute; the others will pass\\nthe night at the Mountain House. I shall stay here, myself: it is not\\nat all likely that anything will come of these warnings; but if there\\nshould, I choose to be here and take my chance.\"\\n\\nIt needs little, generally, to frighten servants, and they were all\\nready enough to go. The poor relation was one of the timid sort, and was\\nterribly uneasy to be got out of the house. This left no alternative, of\\ncourse, for Helen, but to go also. They all urged upon Dudley Venner to\\ngo with them: if there was danger, why should he remain to risk it, when\\nhe sent away the others?\\n\\nOld Sophy said nothing until the time came for her to go with the second\\nof Elbridge\\'s carriage-loads.\\n\\n\"Come, Sophy,\" said Dudley Venner, \"get your things and go. They will\\ntake good care of you at the Mountain House; and when we have made sure\\nthat there is no real danger, you shall come back at once.\"\\n\\n\"No, Massa!\" Sophy answered. \"I\\'ve seen Elsie into th\\' ground, \\'n\\' I\\na\\'n\\'t goin\\' away to come back \\'n\\' fin\\' Massa Venner buried under th\\'\\nrocks. My darlin\\' \\'s gone; \\'n\\' now, if Massa goes, \\'n\\' th\\' ol\\' place\\ngoes, it\\'s time for Ol\\' Sophy to go, too. No, Massa Venner, we\\'ll both\\nstay in th\\' ol\\' mansion \\'n\\' wait for th\\' Lord!\"\\n\\nNothing could change the old woman\\'s determination; and her master, who\\nonly feared, but did not really expect the long-deferred catastrophe,\\nwas obliged to consent to her staying. The sudden drying of the well at\\nsuch a time was the most alarming sign; for he remembered that the same\\nthing had been observed just before great mountain-slides. This long\\nrain, too, was just the kind of cause which was likely to loosen the\\nstrata of rock piled up in the ledges; if the dreaded event should ever\\ncome to pass, it would be at such a time.\\n\\nHe paced his chamber uneasily until long past midnight. If the morning\\ncame without accident, he meant to have a careful examination made of\\nall the rents and fissures above, of their direction and extent, and\\nespecially whether, in case of a mountain-slide, the huge masses would\\nbe like to reach so far to the east and so low down the declivity as the\\nmansion.\\n\\nAt two o\\'clock in the morning he was dozing in his chair. Old Sophy had\\nlain down on her bed, and was muttering in troubled dreams.\\n\\nAll at once a loud crash seemed to rend the very heavens above them: a\\ncrack as of the thunder that follows close upon the bolt,--a rending and\\ncrushing as of a forest snapped through all its stems, torn, twisted,\\nsplintered, dragged with all its ragged boughs into one chaotic ruin.\\nThe ground trembled under them as in an earthquake; the old mansion\\nshuddered so that all its windows chattered in their casements; the\\ngreat chimney shook off its heavy cap-stones, which came down on the\\nroof with resounding concussions; and the echoes of The Mountain roared\\nand bellowed in long reduplication, as if its whole foundations were\\nrent, and this were the terrible voice of its dissolution.\\n\\nDudley Venner rose from his chair, folded his arms, and awaited his\\nfate. There was no knowing where to look for safety; and he remembered\\ntoo well the story of the family that was lost by rushing out of the\\nhouse, and so hurrying into the very jaws of death.\\n\\nHe had stood thus but for a moment, when he heard the voice of Old Sophy\\nin a wild cry of terror:--\\n\\n\"It\\'s the Las\\' Day! It\\'s the Las\\' Day! The Lord is comin\\' to take us\\nall!\"\\n\\n\"Sophy!\" he called; but she did not hear him or heed him, and rushed out\\nof the house.\\n\\nThe worst danger was over. If they were to be destroyed, it would\\nnecessarily be in a few seconds from the first thrill of the terrible\\nconvulsion. He waited in awful suspense, but calm. Not more than one or\\ntwo minutes could have passed before the frightful tumult and all its\\nsounding echoes had ceased. He called Old Sophy; but she did not answer.\\nHe went to the western window and looked forth into the darkness. He\\ncould not distinguish the outlines of the landscape, but the white stone\\nwas clearly visible, and by its side the new-made mound. Nay, what was\\nthat which obscured its outline, in shape like a human figure? He flung\\nopen the window and sprang through. It was all that there was left of\\npoor Old Sophy, stretched out, lifeless, upon her darling\\'s grave.\\n\\nHe had scarcely composed her limbs and drawn the sheet over her, when\\nthe neighbors began to arrive from all directions. Each was expecting to\\nhear of houses overwhelmed and families destroyed; but each came with\\nthe story that his own household was safe. It was not until the morning\\ndawned that the true nature and extent of the sudden movement was\\nascertained. A great seam had opened above the long cliff, and the\\nterrible Rattlesnake Ledge, with all its envenomed reptiles, its\\ndark fissures and black caverns, was buried forever beneath a mighty\\nincumbent mass of ruin.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXI.\\n\\nMR. SILAS PECKHAM RENDERS HIS ACCOUNT.\\n\\n\\nThe morning rose clear and bright. The long storm was over, and the calm\\nautumnal sunshine was now to return, with all its infinite repose and\\nsweetness. With the earliest dawn exploring parties were out in every\\ndirection along the southern <DW72> of The Mountain, tracing the ravages\\nof the great slide and the track it had followed. It proved to be not so\\nmuch a slide as the breaking off and falling of a vast line of cliff,\\nincluding the dreaded Ledge. It had folded over like the leaves of a\\nhalf-opened book when they close, crushing the trees below, piling its\\nruins in a glacis at the foot of what had been the overhanging wall of\\nthe cliff, and filling up that deep cavity above the mansion-house which\\nbore the ill-omened name of Dead Man\\'s Hollow. This it was which had\\nsaved the Dudley mansion. The falling masses, or huge fragments\\nbreaking off from them, would have swept the house and all around it to\\ndestruction but for this deep shelving dell, into which the stream of\\nruin was happily directed. It was, indeed, one of Nature\\'s conservative\\nrevolutions; for the fallen masses made a kind of shelf, which\\ninterposed a level break between the inclined planes above and below it,\\nso that the nightmare-fancies of the dwellers in the Dudley mansion, and\\nin many other residences under the shadow of The Mountain, need not keep\\nthem lying awake hereafter to listen for the snapping of roots and the\\nsplitting of the rocks above them.\\n\\nTwenty-four hours after the falling of the cliff, it seemed as if it had\\nhappened ages ago. The new fact had fitted itself in with all the old\\npredictions, forebodings, fears, and acquired the solidarity belonging\\nto all events which have slipped out of the fingers of Time and\\ndissolved in the antecedent eternity.\\n\\nOld Sophy was lying dead in the Dudley mansion. If there were tears shed\\nfor her, they could not be bitter ones; for she had lived out her full\\nmeasure of days, and gone--who could help fondly believing it?--to\\nrejoin her beloved mistress. They made a place for her at the foot of\\nthe two mounds. It was thus she would have chosen to sleep, and not to\\nhave wronged her humble devotion in life by asking to lie at the side of\\nthose whom she had served so long and faithfully. There were very few\\npresent at the simple ceremony. Helen Darley was one of these few. The\\nold black woman had been her companion in all the kind offices of which\\nshe had been the ministering angel to Elsie.\\n\\nAfter it was all over, Helen was leaving with the rest, when Dudley\\nVenner begged her to stay a little, and he would send her back: it was\\na long walk; besides, he wished to say some things to her, which he had\\nnot had the opportunity of speaking. Of course Helen could not refuse\\nhim; there must be many thoughts coming into his mind which he would\\nwish to share with her who had known his daughter so long and been with\\nher in her last days.\\n\\nShe returned into the great parlor with the wrought cornices and the\\nmedallion-portraits on the ceiling.\\n\\n\"I am now alone in the world,\" Dudley Venner said.\\n\\nHelen must have known that before he spoke. But the tone in which he\\nsaid it had so much meaning, that she could not find a word to answer\\nhim with. They sat in silence, which the old tall clock counted out in\\nlong seconds; but it was a silence which meant more than any words they\\nhad ever spoken.\\n\\n\"Alone in the world! Helen, the freshness of my life is gone, and there\\nis little left of the few graces which in my younger days might have\\nfitted me to win the love of women. Listen to me,--kindly, if you can;\\nforgive me, at least. Half my life has been passed in constant fear and\\nanguish, without any near friend to share my trials. My task is done\\nnow; my fears have ceased to prey upon me; the sharpness of early\\nsorrows has yielded something of its edge to time. You have bound me to\\nyou by gratitude in the tender care you have taken of my poor child.\\nMore than this. I must tell you all now, out of the depth of this\\ntrouble through which I am passing. I have loved you from the moment\\nwe first met; and if my life has anything left worth accepting, it is\\nyours. Will you take the offered gift?\"\\n\\nHelen looked in his face, surprised, bewildered.\\n\\n\"This is not for me,--not for me,\" she said. \"I am but a poor faded\\nflower, not worth the gathering of such a one as you. No, no,--I have\\nbeen bred to humble toil all my days, and I could not be to you what\\nyou ought to ask. I am accustomed to a kind of loneliness and\\nself-dependence. I have seen nothing, almost, of the world, such as you\\nwere born to move in. Leave me to my obscure place and duties; I shall\\nat least have peace;--and you--you will surely find in due time some one\\nbetter fitted by Nature and training to make you happy.\"\\n\\n\"No, Miss Darley!\" Dudley Venner said, almost sternly. \"You must not\\nspeak to a man who has lived through my experiences of looking about for\\na new choice after his heart has once chosen. Say that you can never\\nlove me; say that I have lived too long to share your young life; say\\nthat sorrow has left nothing in me for Love to find his pleasure in; but\\ndo not mock me with the hope of a new affection for some unknown object.\\nThe first look of yours brought me to your side. The first tone of your\\nvoice sunk into my heart. From this moment my life must wither out or\\nbloom anew. My home is desolate. Come under my roof and make it bright\\nonce more,--share my life with me,--or I shall give the halls of the old\\nmansion to the bats and the owls, and wander forth alone without a hope\\nor a friend!\"\\n\\nTo find herself with a man\\'s future at the disposal of a single word of\\nhers!--a man like this, too, with a fascination for her against which\\nshe had tried to shut her heart, feeling that he lived in another sphere\\nthan hers, working as she was for her bread, a poor operative in the\\nfactory of a hard master and jealous overseer, the salaried drudge of\\nMr. Silas Peckham! Why, she had thought he was grateful to her as a\\nfriend of his daughter; she had even pleased herself with the feeling\\nthat he liked her, in her humble place, as a woman of some cultivation\\nand many sympathetic! points of relation with himself; but that he\\n_loved_ her,--that this deep, fine nature, in a man so far removed from\\nher in outward circumstance, should have found its counterpart in one\\nwhom life had treated so coldly as herself,--that Dudley Venner should\\nstake his happiness on a breath of hers,--poor Helen Darley\\'s,--it was\\nall a surprise, a confusion, a kind of fear not wholly fearful. Ah, me!\\nwomen know what it is,--that mist over the eyes, that trembling in the\\nlimbs, that faltering of the voice, that sweet, shame-faced, unspoken\\nconfession of weakness which does not wish to be strong, that sudden\\noverflow in the soul where thoughts loose their hold on each other and\\nswim single and helpless in the flood of emotion,--women know what it\\nis!\\n\\nNo doubt she was a little frightened and a good deal bewildered, and\\nthat her sympathies were warmly excited for a friend to whom she had\\nbeen brought so near, and whose loneliness she saw and pitied. She lost\\nthat calm self-possession she had hoped to maintain.\\n\\n\"If I thought that I could make you happy,--if I should speak from my\\nheart, and not my reason,--I am but a weak woman,--yet if I can be to\\nyou--What can I say?\"\\n\\nWhat more could this poor, dear Helen say?\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"Elbridge, harness the horses and take Miss Darley back to the school.\"\\n\\nWhat conversation had taken place since Helen\\'s rhetorical failure is\\nnot recorded in the minutes from which this narrative is constructed.\\nBut when the man who had been summoned had gone to get the carriage\\nready, Helen resumed something she had been speaking of.\\n\\n\"Not for the world! Everything must go on just as it has gone on, for\\nthe present. There are proprieties to be consulted. I cannot be\\nhard with you, that out of your very affliction has sprung\\nthis--this--well--you must name it for me,--but the world will never\\nlisten to explanations. I am to be Helen Darley, lady assistant in Mr.\\nSilas Peckham\\'s school, as long as I see fit to hold my office. And I\\nmean to attend to my scholars just as before; so that I shall have very\\nlittle time for visiting or seeing company. I believe, though, you are\\none of the Trustees and a Member of the Examining Committee; so that, if\\nyou should happen to visit the school, I shall try to be civil to you.\"\\n\\nEvery lady sees, of course, that Helen was quite right; but perhaps here\\nand there one will think that Dudley Venner was all wrong,--that he was\\ntoo hasty,--that he should have been too full of his recent grief for\\nsuch a confession as he has just made, and the passion from which it\\nsprung. Perhaps they do not understand the sudden recoil of a strong\\nnature long compressed. Perhaps they have not studied the mystery of\\n_allotropism_ in the emotions of the human heart. Go to the nearest\\nchemist and ask him to show you some of the dark-red phosphorus which\\nwill not burn, without fierce heating, but at 500 deg., Fahrenheit, changes\\nback again to the inflammable substance we know so well. Grief seems\\nmore like ashes than like fire; but as grief has been love once, so it\\nmay become love again. This is emotional allotropism.\\n\\nHelen rode back to the Institute and inquired for Mr. Peckham. She had\\nnot seen him during the brief interval between her departure from the\\nmansion-house and her return to Old Sophy\\'s funeral. There were various\\nquestions about the school she wished to ask.\\n\\n\"Oh, how\\'s your haaelth, Miss Darley?\" Silas began. \"We\\'ve missed you\\nconsid\\'able. Glad to see you back at the post of dooty. Hope the Squire\\ntreated you hahnsomely,--liberal pecooniary compensation,--hey? A\\'n\\'t\\nmuch of a loser, I guess, by acceptin\\' his propositions?\"\\n\\nHelen blushed at this last question, as if Silas had meant something by\\nit beyond asking what money she had received; but his own double-meaning\\nexpression and her blush were too nice points for him to have taken\\ncognizance of. He was engaged in a mental calculation as to the amount\\nof the deduction he should make under the head of \"damage to the\\ninstitootion,\"--this depending somewhat on that of the \"pecooniary\\ncompensation\" she might have received for her services as the friend of\\nElsie Venner.\\n\\nSo Helen slid back at once into her routine, the same faithful, patient\\ncreature she had always been. But what was this new light which seemed\\nto have kindled in her eyes? What was this look of peace, which nothing\\ncould disturb, which smiled serenely through all the little meannesses\\nwith which the daily life of the educational factory surrounded\\nher,--which not only made her seem resigned, but overflowed all her\\nfeatures with a thoughtful, subdued happiness? Mr. Bernard did not\\nknow,--perhaps he did not guess. The inmates of the Dudley mansion were\\nnot scandalized by any mysterious visits of a veiled or unveiled lady.\\nThe vibrating tongues of the \"female youth\" of the Institute were not\\nset in motion by the standing of an equipage at the gate, waiting for\\ntheir lady teacher. The servants at the mansion did not convey numerous\\nletters with superscriptions in a bold, manly hand, sealed with the arms\\nof a well-known house, and directed to Miss Helen Darley; nor, on the\\nother hand, did Hiram, the man from the lean streak in New Hampshire,\\ncarry sweet-smelling, rose-hued, many-layered, criss-crossed,\\nfine-stitch-lettered packages of note-paper directed to Dudley Venner,\\nEsq., and all too scanty to hold that incredible expansion of the famous\\nthree words which a woman was born to say,--that perpetual miracle which\\nastonishes all the go-betweens who wear their shoes out in carrying a\\nwoman\\'s infinite variations on the theme, \"I love you.\"\\n\\nBut the reader must remember that there are walks in country-towns where\\npeople are liable to meet by accident, and that the hollow of an old\\ntree has served the purpose of a post-office sometimes; so that he has\\nher choice (to divide the pronouns impartially) of various hypotheses to\\naccount for the new glory of happiness which seemed to have irradiated\\nour poor Helen\\'s features, as if her dreary life were awakening in the\\ndawn of a blessed future.\\n\\nWith all the alleviations which have been hinted at, Mr. Dudley Venner\\nthought that the days and the weeks had never moved so slowly as through\\nthe last period of the autumn that was passing. Elsie had been a\\nperpetual source of anxiety to him, but still she had been a companion.\\nHe could not mourn for her; for he felt that she was safer with her\\nmother, in that world where there are no more sorrows and dangers, than\\nshe could have been with him. But as he sat at his window and looked at\\nthe three mounds, the loneliness of the great house made it seem more\\nlike the sepulchre than these narrow dwellings where his beloved and her\\ndaughter lay close to each other, side by side,--Catalina, the bride\\nof his youth, and Elsie, the child whom he had nurtured, with poor Old\\nSophy, who had followed them like a black shadow, at their feet, under\\nthe same soft turf, sprinkled with the brown autumnal leaves. It was not\\ngood for him to be thus alone. How should he ever live through the long\\nmonths of November and December?\\n\\nThe months of November and December did, in some way or other, get\\nrid of themselves at last, bringing with them the usual events of\\nvillage-life and a few unusual ones. Some of the geologists had been up\\nto look at the great slide, of which they gave those prolix accounts\\nwhich everybody remembers who read the scientific journals of the time.\\nThe engineers reported that there was little probability of any further\\nconvulsion along the line of rocks which overhung the more thickly\\nsettled part of the town. The naturalists drew up a paper on the\\n\"Probable Extinction of the _Crotalus Durissus_ in the Township of\\nRockland.\" The engagement of the Widow Rowens to a Little Millionville\\nmerchant was announced,--\"Sudding \\'n\\' onexpected,\" Widow Leech\\nsaid,--\"waaelthy, or she wouldn\\'t ha\\' looked at him,--fifty year old, if\\nhe is a day, _\\'n\\' ha\\'n\\'t got a white hair in his head.\"_ The Reverend\\nChauncy Fairweather had publicly announced that he was going to join the\\nRoman Catholic communion,--not so much to the surprise or consternation\\nof the religious world as he had supposed. Several old ladies forthwith\\nproclaimed their intention of following him; but, as one or two of them\\nwere deaf, and another had been threatened with an attack of that mild,\\nbut obstinate complaint, _dementia senilis_, many thought it was not so\\nmuch the force of his arguments as a kind of tendency to jump as the\\nbellwether jumps, well known in flocks not included in the Christian\\nfold. His bereaved congregation immediately began pulling candidates on\\nand off, like new boots, on trial. Some pinched in tender places; some\\nwere too loose; some were too square-toed; some were too coarse, and\\ndidn\\'t please; some were too thin, and wouldn\\'t last;--in short, they\\ncouldn\\'t possibly find a fit. At last people began to drop in to hear\\nold Doctor Honeywood. They were quite surprised to find what a human old\\ngentleman he was, and went back and told the others, that, instead of\\nbeing a case of confluent sectarianism, as they supposed, the good old\\nminister had been so well vaccinated with charitable virus that he was\\nnow a true, open-souled Christian of the mildest type. The end of all\\nwhich was, that the liberal people went over to the old minister almost\\nin a body, just at the time that Deacon Shearer and the \"Vinegar-Bible\"\\nparty split off, and that not long afterwards they sold their own\\nmeeting-house to the malecontents, so that Deacon Soper used often to\\nremind Colonel Sprowle of his wish that \"our little man and him [the\\nReverend Doctor] would swop pulpits,\" and tell him it had \"pooty nigh\\ncome trew.\"--But this is anticipating the course of events, which were\\nmuch longer in coming about; for we have but just got through that\\nterribly long month, as Mr. Dudley Venner found it, of December.\\n\\nOn the first of January, Mr. Silas Peckham was in the habit of settling\\nhis quarterly accounts, and making such new arrangements as his\\nconvenience or interest dictated. New-Year was a holiday at the\\nInstitute. No doubt this accounted for Helen\\'s being dressed so\\ncharmingly,--always, to be sure, in her own simple way, but yet with\\nsuch a true lady\\'s air that she looked fit to be the mistress of any\\nmansion in the land.\\n\\nShe was in the parlor alone, a little before noon, when Mr. Peckham came\\nin.\\n\\n\"I\\'m ready to settle my account with you now, Miss Darley,\" said Silas.\\n\\n\"As you please, Mr. Peckham,\" Helen answered, very graciously.\\n\\n\"Before payin\\' you your selary,\" the Principal continued, \"I wish to\\ncome to an understandin\\' as to the futur\\'. I consider that I\\'ve been\\npayin\\' high, very high, for the work you do. Women\\'s wages can\\'t be\\nexpected to do more than feed and clothe \\'em, as a gineral thing, with\\na little savin\\', in case of sickness, and to bury \\'em, if they\\nbreak daown, as all of \\'em are liable to do at any time. If I a\\'n\\'t\\nmisinformed, you not only support yourself out of my establishment, but\\nlikewise relatives of yours, who I don\\'t know that I\\'m called upon to\\nfeed and clothe. There is a young woman, not burdened with destitoot\\nrelatives, has signified that she would be glad to take your dooties for\\nless pecooniary compensation, by a consid\\'able amaount, than you now\\nreceive. I shall be willin\\', however, to retain your services at sech\\nredooced rate as we shall fix upon,--provided sech redooced rate be as\\nlow or lower than the same services can be obtained elsewhere.\"\\n\\n\"As you please, Mr. Peckham,\" Helen answered, with a smile so sweet that\\nthe Principal (who of course had trumped up this opposition-teacher for\\nthe occasion) said to himself she would stand being cut down a quarter,\\nperhaps a half, of her salary.\\n\\n\"Here is your accaount, Miss Darley, and the balance doo you,\"\\nsaid Silas Peckham, handing her a paper and a small roll of\\ninfectious-flavored bills wrapping six poisonous coppers of the old\\ncoinage.\\n\\nShe took the paper and began looking at it. She could not quite make up\\nher mind to touch the feverish bills with the cankering copper in them,\\nand left them airing themselves on the table.\\n\\nThe document she held ran as follows:\\n\\n  _Silas Peckham, Esq., Principal of the Apollinean Institute,\\n  In Account with Helen Darley, Assist. Teacher._\\n\\n  _Dr._\\n  To Salary for quarter ending Jan. 1st,\\n  @ $75 per quarter  .  .  .  .  .  . $75.00\\n\\n  ______\\n  $75.00\\n\\n  _Cr._\\n  By Deduction for absence, 1 week 8\\n  days   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . $10.00\\n  \" Board, lodging, etc., for 10 days,\\n  @ 75 cts. per day  .  .  .  .  .  .   7.50\\n  \" Damage to Institution by absence\\n  of teacher from duties, say .  .  .  25.00\\n  \" Stationery furnished .  .  .  .  .    43\\n  \" Postage-stamp  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    01\\n  \" Balance due Helen Darley   .  .   $32.06\\n  ______\\n  $75.00\\n\\n  ROCKLAND, Jan. 1st, 1859.\\n\\nNow Helen had her own private reasons for wishing to receive the\\nsmall sum which was due her at this time without any unfair\\ndeduction,--reasons which we need not inquire into too particularly,\\nas we may be very sure that they were right and womanly. So, when she\\nlooked over this account of Mr. Silas Peckham\\'s, and saw that he had\\ncontrived to pare down her salary to something less than half its\\nstipulated amount, the look which her countenance wore was as near to\\nthat of righteous indignation as her gentle features and soft blue eyes\\nwould admit of its being.\\n\\n\"Why, Mr. Peckham,\" she said, \"do you mean this? If I am of so much\\nvalue to you that you must take off twenty-five dollars for ten days\\'\\nabsence, how is it that my salary is to be cut down to less than\\nseventy-five dollars a quarter, if I remain here?\"\\n\\n\"I gave you fair notice,\" said Silas. \"I have a minute of it I took down\\nimmed\\'ately after the intervoo.\"\\n\\nHe lugged out his large pocket-book with the strap going all round it,\\nand took from it a slip of paper which confirmed his statement.\\n\\n\"Besides,\" he added, slyly, \"I presoom you have received a liberal\\npecooniary compensation from Squire Venner for nussin\\' his daughter.\"\\n\\nHelen was looking over the bill while he was speaking.\\n\\n\"Board and lodging for ten days, Mr. Peckham,--_whose_ board and\\nlodging, pray?\"\\n\\nThe door opened before Silas Peckham could answer, and Mr. Bernard\\nwalked into the parlor. Helen was holding the bill in her hand, looking\\nas any woman ought to look who has been at once wronged and insulted.\\n\\n\"The last turn of the thumbscrew!\" said Mr. Bernard to himself. \"What is\\nit, Helen? You look troubled.\"\\n\\nShe handed him the account.\\n\\nHe looked at the footing of it. Then he looked at the items. Then he\\nlooked at Silas Peckham.\\n\\nAt this moment Silas was sublime. He was so transcendency unconscious of\\nthe emotions going on in Mr. Bernard\\'s mind at the moment, that he had\\nonly a single thought.\\n\\n\"The accaount\\'s correc\\'ly cast, I presoom;--if the\\' \\'s any mistake\\nof figgers or addin\\' \\'em up, it\\'ll be made all right. Everything\\'s\\naccordin\\' to agreement. The minute written immed\\'ately after the\\nintervoo is here in my possession.\"\\n\\nMr. Bernard looked at Helen. Just what would have happened to Silas\\nPeckham, as he stood then and there, but for the interposition of a\\nmerciful Providence, nobody knows or ever will know; for at that moment\\nsteps were heard upon the stairs, and Hiram threw open the parlor-door\\nfor Mr. Dudley Venner to enter.\\n\\nHe saluted them all gracefully with the good-wishes of the season, and\\neach of them returned his compliment,--Helen blushing fearfully, of\\ncourse, but not particularly noticed in her embarrassment by more than\\none.\\n\\nSilas Peckham reckoned with perfect confidence on his Trustees, who had\\nalways said what he told them to, and done what he wanted. It was a good\\nchance now to show off his power, and, by letting his instructors know\\nthe unstable tenure of their offices, make it easier to settle his\\naccounts and arrange his salaries. There was nothing very strange in Mr.\\nVenner\\'s calling; he was one of the Trustees, and this was New Year\\'s\\nDay. But he had called just at the lucky moment for Mr. Peckham\\'s\\nobject.\\n\\n\"I have thought some of makin\\' changes in the department of\\ninstruction,\" he began. \"Several accomplished teachers have applied to\\nme, who would be glad of sitooations. I understand that there never have\\nbeen so many fust-rate teachers, male and female, out of employment as\\ndoorin\\' the present season. If I can make sahtisfahctory arrangements\\nwith my present corpse of teachers, I shall be glad to do so; otherwise\\nI shell, with the permission of the Trustees, make sech noo arrangements\\nas circumstahnces compel.\"\\n\\n\"You may make arrangements for a new assistant in my department, Mr.\\nPeckham,\" said Mr. Bernard, \"at once,--this day,--this hour. I am not\\nsafe to be trusted with your person five minutes out of this lady\\'s\\npresence,--of whom I beg pardon for this strong language. Mr. Venner, I\\nmust beg you, as one of the Trustees of this Institution, to look at the\\nmanner in which its Principal has attempted to swindle this faithful\\nteacher, whose toils and sacrifices and self-devotion to the school\\nhave made it all that it is, in spite of this miserable trader\\'s\\nincompetence. Will you look at the paper I hold?\"\\n\\nDudley Venner took the account and read it through, without changing a\\nfeature. Then he turned to Silas Peckham.\\n\\n\"You may make arrangements for a new assistant in the branches this lady\\nhas taught. Miss Helen Darley is to be my wife. I had hoped to announce\\nthis news in a less abrupt and ungraceful manner. But I came to tell\\nyou with my own lips what you would have learned before evening from my\\nfriends in the village.\"\\n\\nMr. Bernard went to Helen, who stood silent, with downcast eyes, and\\ntook her hand warmly, hoping she might find all the happiness she\\ndeserved. Then he turned to Dudley Venner, and said,--\\n\\n\"She is a queen, but has never found it out. The world has nothing\\nnobler than this dear woman, whom you have discovered in the disguise of\\na teacher. God bless her and you!\"\\n\\nDudley Venner returned his friendly grasp, without answering a word in\\narticulate speech.\\n\\nSilas remained dumb and aghast for a brief space. Coming to himself\\na little, he thought there might have been some mistake about the\\nitems,--would like to have Miss Darley\\'s bill returned,--would make it\\nall right,--had no idee that Squire Venner had a special int\\'rest in\\nMiss Darley,--was sorry he had given offence,--if he might take that\\nbill and look it over--\\n\\n\"No, Mr. Peckham,\" said Mr. Dudley Venner; \"there will be a full meeting\\nof the Board next week, and the bill, and such evidence with reference\\nto the management of the Institution and the treatment of its\\ninstructors as Mr. Langdon sees fit to bring forward, will be laid\\nbefore them.\"\\n\\nMiss Helen Darley became that very day the guest of Miss Arabella\\nThornton, the Judge\\'s daughter. Mr. Bernard made his appearance a week\\nor two later at the Lectures, where the Professor first introduced him\\nto the reader.\\n\\nHe stayed after the class had left the room.\\n\\n\"Ah, Mr. Langdon! how do you do? Very glad to see you back again. How\\nhave you been since our correspondence on Fascination and other curious\\nscientific questions?\"\\n\\nIt was the Professor who spoke,--whom the reader will recognize as\\nmyself, the teller of this story.\\n\\n\"I have been well,\" Mr. Bernard answered, with a serious look which\\ninvited a further question.\\n\\n\"I hope you have had none of those painful or dangerous experiences you\\nseemed to be thinking of when you wrote; at any rate, you have escaped\\nhaving your obituary written.\"\\n\\n\"I have seen some things worth remembering. Shall I call on you this\\nevening and tell you about them?\"\\n\\n\"I shall be most happy to see you.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThis was the way in which I, the Professor, became acquainted with some\\nof the leading events of this story. They interested me sufficiently\\nto lead me to avail myself of all those other extraordinary methods of\\nobtaining information well known to writers of narrative.\\n\\nMr. Langdon seemed to me to have gained in seriousness and strength of\\ncharacter by his late experiences. He threw his whole energies into\\nhis studies with an effect which distanced all his previous efforts.\\nRemembering my former hint, he employed his spare hours in writing for\\nthe annual prizes, both of which he took by a unanimous vote of the\\njudges. Those who heard him read his Thesis at the Medical Commencement\\nwill not soon forget the impression made by his fine personal appearance\\nand manners, nor the universal interest excited in the audience, as\\nhe read, with his beautiful enunciation, that striking paper entitled\\n\"Unresolved Nebulas in Vital Science.\" It was a general remark of the\\nFaculty,--and old Doctor Kittredge, who had come down on purpose to hear\\nMr. Langdon, heartily agreed to it,--that there had never been a diploma\\nfilled up, since the institution which conferred upon him the degree of\\n_Doctor Medicinae_ was founded, which carried with it more of promise to\\nthe profession than that which bore the name of\\n\\nBernardus Caryl Langdon\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXII\\n\\nCONCLUSION.\\n\\n\\nMr. Bernard Langdon had no sooner taken his degree, than, in accordance\\nwith the advice of one of his teachers whom he frequently consulted, he\\ntook an office in the heart of the city where he had studied. He had\\nthought of beginning in a suburb or some remoter district of the city\\nproper.\\n\\n\"No,\" said his teacher,--to wit, myself,--\"don\\'t do any such thing. You\\nare made for the best kind of practice; don\\'t hamper yourself with an\\noutside constituency, such as belongs to a practitioner of the second\\nclass. When a fellow like you chooses his beat, he must look ahead a\\nlittle. Take care of all the poor that apply to you, but leave the\\nhalf-pay classes to a different style of doctor,--the people who spend\\none half their time in taking care of their patients, and the other half\\nin squeezing out their money. Go for the swell-fronts and south-exposure\\nhouses; the folks inside are just as good as other people, and the\\npleasantest, on the whole, to take care of. They must have somebody, and\\nthey like a gentleman best. Don\\'t throw yourself away. You have a\\ngood presence and pleasing manners. You wear white linen by inherited\\ninstinct. You can pronounce the word _view_. You have all the elements\\nof success; go and take it. Be polite and generous, but don\\'t undervalue\\nyourself. You will be useful, at any rate; you may just as well be\\nhappy, while you are about it. The highest social class furnishes\\nincomparably the best patients, taking them by and large. Besides, when\\nthey won\\'t get well and bore you to death, you can send \\'em off to\\ntravel. Mind me now, and take the tops of your sparrowgrass. Somebody\\nmust have \\'em,--why shouldn\\'t you? If you don\\'t take your chance, you\\'ll\\nget the butt-ends as a matter of course.\"\\n\\nMr. Bernard talked like a young man full of noble sentiments. He wanted\\nto be useful to his fellow-beings. Their social differences were nothing\\nto him. He would never court the rich,--he would go where he was called.\\nHe would rather save the life of a poor mother of a family than that of\\nhalf a dozen old gouty millionnaires whose heirs had been yawning and\\nstretching these ten years to get rid of them.\\n\\n\"Generous emotions!\" I exclaimed. \"Cherish \\'em; cling to \\'em till you\\nare fifty,--till you are seventy,--till you are ninety! But do as I tell\\nyou,--strike for the best circle of practice, and you\\'ll be sure to get\\nit!\"\\n\\nMr. Langdon did as I told him,--took a genteel office, furnished it\\nneatly, dressed with a certain elegance, soon made a pleasant circle\\nof acquaintances, and began to work his way into the right kind of\\nbusiness. I missed him, however, for some days, not long after he had\\nopened his office. On his return, he told me he had been up at Rockland,\\nby special invitation, to attend the wedding of Mr. Dudley Venner and\\nMiss Helen Darley. He gave me a full account of the ceremony, which\\nI regret that I cannot relate in full. \"Helen looked like an\\nangel,\"--that, I am sure, was one of his expressions. As for her dress,\\nI should like to give the details, but am afraid of committing blunders,\\nas men always do, when they undertake to describe such matters. White\\ndress, anyhow,--that I am sure of,--with orange-flowers, and the most\\nwonderful lace veil that was ever seen or heard of. The Reverend Doctor\\nHoneywood performed the ceremony, of course. The good people seemed to\\nhave forgotten they ever had had any other minister,--except Deacon\\nShearer and his set of malecontents, who were doing a dull business in\\nthe meeting-house lately occupied by the Reverend Mr. Fairweather.\\n\\n\"Who was at the wedding?\"\\n\\n\"Everybody, pretty much. They wanted to keep it quiet, but it was of no\\nuse. Married at church. Front pews, old Doctor Kittredge and all the\\nmansion-house people and distinguished strangers,--Colonel Sprowle and\\nfamily, including Matilda\\'s young gentleman, a graduate of one of\\nthe fresh-water colleges,--Mrs. Pickins (late Widow Rowens) and\\nhusband,--Deacon Soper and numerous parishioners. A little nearer the\\ndoor, Abel, the Doctor\\'s man, and Elbridge, who drove them to church in,\\nthe family-coach. Father Fairweather, as they all call him now, came in\\nlate, with Father McShane.\"\\n\\n\"And Silas Peckham?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Silas had left The School and Rockland. Cut up altogether too\\nbadly in the examination instituted by the Trustees. Had moved over\\nto Tamarack, and thought of renting a large house and \\'farming\\' the\\ntown-poor.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nSome time after this, as I was walking with a young friend along by the\\nswell-fronts and south-exposures, whom should I see but Mr. Bernard\\nLangdon, looking remarkably happy, and keeping step by the side of a\\nvery handsome and singularly well-dressed young lady? He bowed and\\nlifted his hat as we passed.\\n\\n\"Who is that pretty girl my young doctor has got there?\" I said to my\\ncompanion.\\n\\n\"Who is that?\" he answered. \"You don\\'t know? Why, that is neither more\\nnor less than Miss Letitia Forester, daughter of--of--why, the great\\nbanking-firm, you know, Bilyuns Brothers & Forester. Got acquainted with\\nher in the country, they say. There\\'s a story that they\\'re engaged, or\\nlike to be, if the firm consents.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" I said.\\n\\nI did not like the look of it in the least. Too young,--too young. Has\\nnot taken any position yet. No right to ask for the hand of Bilyuns\\nBrothers & Co.\\'s daughter. Besides, it will spoil him for practice, if\\nhe marries a rich girl before he has formed habits of work.\\n\\nI looked in at his office the next day. A box of white kids was lying\\nopen on the table. A three-cornered note, directed in a very delicate\\nlady\\'s-hand, was distinguishable among a heap of papers. I was just\\ngoing to call him to account for his proceedings, when he pushed\\nthe three-cornered note aside and took up a letter with a great\\ncorporation-seal upon it. He had received the offer of a professor\\'s\\nchair in an ancient and distinguished institution.\\n\\n\"Pretty well for three-and-twenty, my boy,\" I said. \"I suppose you\\'ll\\nthink you must be married one of these days, if you accept this office.\"\\n\\nMr. Langdon blushed.--There had been stories about him, he knew. His\\nname had been mentioned in connection with that of a very charming young\\nlady. The current reports were not true. He had met this young lady,\\nand been much pleased with her, in the country, at the house of her\\ngrandfather, the Reverend Doctor Honeywood,--you remember Miss Letitia\\nForester, whom I have mentioned repeatedly? On coming to town, he found\\nhis country-acquaintance in a social position which seemed to discourage\\nhis continued intimacy. He had discovered, however, that he was a not\\nunwelcome visitor, and had kept up friendly relations with her. But\\nthere was no truth in the current reports,--none at all.\\n\\nSome months had passed, after this visit, when I happened one evening to\\nstroll into a box in one of the principal theatres of the city. A small\\nparty sat on the seats before me: a middle-aged gentleman and his lady,\\nin front, and directly behind them my young doctor and the same very\\nhandsome young lady I had seen him walking with on the side-walk before\\nthe swell-fronts and south-exposures. As Professor Langdon seemed to be\\nvery much taken up with his companion, and both of them looked as if\\nthey were enjoying themselves, I determined not to make my presence\\nknown to my young friend, and to withdraw quietly after feasting my eyes\\nwith the sight of them for a few minutes.\\n\\n\"It looks as if something might come of it,\" I said to myself.\\n\\nAt that moment the young lady lifted her arm accidentally, in such a way\\nthat the light fell upon the clasp of a chain which encircled her wrist.\\nMy eyes filled with tears as I read upon the clasp, in sharp-cut Italic\\nletters, _E.V._ They were tears at once of sad remembrance and of joyous\\nanticipation; for the ornament on which I looked was the double\\npledge of a dead sorrow and a living affection. It was the golden\\nbracelet,--the parting-gift of Elsie Venner.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nBUBBLES.\\n\\n\\nI.\\n\\n  I stood on the brink in childhood,\\n  And watched the bubbles go\\n  From the rock-fretted sunny ripple\\n  To the smoother lymph below;\\n\\n  And over the white creek-bottom,\\n  Under them every one,\\n  Went golden stars in the water,\\n  All luminous with the sun.\\n\\n  But the bubbles brake on the surface,\\n  And under, the stars of gold\\n  Brake, and the hurrying water\\n  Flowed onward, swift and cold.\\n\\n\\nII.\\n\\n  I stood on the brink in manhood,\\n  And it came to my weary heart,--\\n  In my breast so dull and heavy,\\n  After the years of smart,--\\n\\n  That every hollowest bubble\\n  Which over my life had passed\\n  Still into its deeper current\\n  Some sky-sweet gleam had cast;\\n\\n  That, however I mocked it gayly,\\n  And guessed at its hollowness,\\n  Still shone, with each bursting bubble,\\n  One star in my soul the less.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCITIES AND PARKS:\\n\\nWITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE NEW YORK CENTRAL PARK.\\n\\n\\nThe first murderer was the first city-builder; and a good deal of\\nmurdering has been carried on in the interest of city-building ever\\nsince Cain\\'s day. Narrow and crooked streets, want of proper sewerage\\nand ventilation, the absence of forethought in providing open spaces for\\nthe recreation of the people, the allowance of intramural burials,\\nand of fetid nuisances, such as slaughter-houses and manufactories of\\noffensive stuffs, have converted cities into pestilential inclosures,\\nand kept Jefferson\\'s saying--\"Great cities are great sores\"--true in its\\nmost literal and mortifying sense.\\n\\nThere is some excuse for the crowded and irregular character of\\nOld-World cities. They grew, and were not builded. Accumulations\\nof people, who lighted like bees upon a chance branch, they found\\nthemselves hived in obdurate brick and mortar before they knew it; and\\nthen, to meet the necessities of their cribbed, cabined, and confined\\ncondition, they must tear down sacred landmarks, sacrifice invaluable\\npossessions, and trample on prescriptive rights, to provide\\nbreathing-room for their gasping population. Besides, air, water, light,\\nand cleanliness are modern innovations. The nose seems to have acquired\\nits sensitiveness within a hundred years,--the lungs their objection to\\nfoul air, and the palate its disgust at ditch-water like the Thames,\\nwithin a more recent period. Honestly dirty, and robustly indifferent to\\nwhat mortally offends our squeamish senses, our happy ancestors fattened\\non carbonic acid gas, and took the exhalations of graveyards and gutters\\nwith a placidity of stomach that excites our physiological admiration.\\nIf they died, it was not for want of air. The pestilence carried, them\\noff,--and that was a providential enemy, whose home-bred origin nobody\\nsuspected.\\n\\nIt must seem to foreigners of all things the strangest, that, in a\\ncountry where land is sold at one dollar and twenty-five cents the acre\\nby the square mile, there should in any considerable part of it be a\\nwant of room,--any necessity for crowding the population into pent-up\\ncities,--any narrowness of streets, or want of commons and parks. And\\nyet it is an undeniable truth that our American cities are all suffering\\nthe want of ample thoroughfares, destitute of adequate parks and\\ncommons, and too much crowded for health, convenience, or beauty. Boston\\nhas for its main street a serpentine lane, wide enough to drive the cows\\nhome from their pastures, but totally and almost fatally inadequate\\nto be the great artery of a city of two hundred thousand people.\\nPhiladelphia is little better off with her narrow Chestnut Street,\\nwhich purchases what accommodation it affords by admitting the parallel\\nstreets to nearly equal use, and thus sacrificing the very idea of a\\nmetropolitan thoroughfare, in which the splendor and motion and life\\nof a metropolis ought to be concentrated. New York succeeds in making\\nBroadway what the Toledo, the Strand, the Linden Strasse, the Italian\\nBoulevards are; but the street is notoriously blocked and confused, and\\noccasions more loss of time and temper and life and limb than would\\namply repay, once in five years, the widening of it to double its\\npresent breadth.\\n\\nIt is a great misfortune, that our commercial metropolis, the\\npredestined home of five millions of people, should not have a single\\nstreet worthy of the population, the wealth, the architectural ambition\\nready to fill and adorn it. Wholesale trade, bankers, brokers, and\\nlawyers seek narrow streets. There must be swift communication between\\nthe opposite sides, and easy recognition of faces across the way. But\\nretail trade requires no such conditions. The passers up and down on\\nopposite sides of Broadway are as if in different streets, and neither\\nexpect to recognize each other nor to pass from one to the other without\\nset effort. It took a good while to make Broad and Canal Streets\\nattractive business-streets, and to get the importers and jobbers out\\nof Pearl Street; but the work is now done. The Bowery affords the only\\nremaining chance of building a magnificent metropolitan thoroughfare in\\nNew York; and we anticipate the day--when Broadway will surrender its\\npretensions to that now modest Cheapside. Already, about the confluence\\nof the Third and Fourth Avenues at Eighth Street are congregated some\\nof the chief institutions of the city,--the Bible House, the Cooper\\nInstitute, the Astor Library, the Mercantile Library. Farther down,\\nthe continuation of Canal Street affords the most commanding sites for\\nfuture public edifices; while the neighborhoods of Franklin and Chatham\\nSquares ought to be seized upon to embellish the city at imperial points\\nwith its finest architectural piles. The capacities of New York, below\\nUnion Square, for metropolitan splendor are entirely undeveloped; the\\nbest points are still occupied by comparatively worthless buildings, and\\nthe future will produce a now unlooked-for change in the whole character\\nof that great district.\\n\\nThe huddling together of our American cities is due to the recentness\\nof the time when space was our greatest enemy and sparseness our chief\\ndiscouragement. Our founders hated room as much as a backwoods farmer\\nhates trees. The protecting walls, which narrowed the ways and cramped\\nthe houses of the Old-World cities, did not put a severer compress\\nupon them, than the disgust of solitude and the craving for \"the sweet\\nsecurity of streets\" threw about our city-builders. In the Western towns\\nnow, they carefully give a city air to their villages by crowding the\\nfew stores and houses of which they are composed into the likeliest\\nappearance of an absolute scarcity of space.\\n\\nThey labor unconsciously to look crowded, and would sooner go into a\\ncellar to eat their oysters than have them in the finest saloon above\\nground. And so, if a peninsula like Boston, or a miniature Mesopotamia\\nlike New York, or a basin like Cincinnati, could be found to tuck away\\na town in, in which there was a decent chance of covering over the\\nnakedness of the land within a thousand years, they rejoiced to seize\\non it and warm their shivering imaginations in the idea of the possible\\nsnugness which their distant posterity might enjoy.\\n\\nBoston owes its only park worth naming--the celebrated Common--to\\nthe necessity of leaving a convenient cow-pasture for the babes and\\nsucklings of that now mature community. Forty acres were certainly\\nnever more fortunately situated for their predestined service, nor more\\nprovidentially rescued for the higher uses of man. May the memory of the\\nweaning babes who pleaded for the spot where their \"milky mothers\" fed\\nbe ever sacred in our Athens, and may the cows of Boston be embalmed\\nwith the bulls of Egypt! A white heifer should be perpetually grazing,\\nat her tether, in the shadow of the Great Elm. Would it be wholly\\nunbecoming one born in full view of that lovely inclosure to suggest\\nthat the straightness of the lines in which the trees are planted on\\nBoston Common, and the rapidly increasing thickness of their foliage,\\ndestroy in the summer season the effect of breadth and liberty, hide\\nboth the immediate and the distant landscape, stifle the breeze, and\\ndiminish the attractiveness of the spot? Fewer trees, scattered in\\nclumps and paying little regard to paths, would vastly improve the\\neffect. The colonnades of the malls furnish all the shade desirable in\\nso small an inclosure.\\n\\nFor the most part, the proper laying-out of cities is both a matter of\\ngreater ease and greater importance in America than anywhere else. We\\nare much in the condition of those old Scriptural worthies, of whom it\\ncould be so coolly said, \"So he went and built a city,\" as if it were\\na matter of not much greater account than \"So be went and built a\\nlog-house.\" Very likely some of those Biblical cities, extemporized\\nso tersely, were not much more finished than those we now and then\\nencounter in our Western and Southern tours, where a poor shed at four\\ncross-roads is dignified with the title. We believe it was Samuel\\nDexter, the pattern of Webster, who, on hanging out his shingle in a\\nNew England village, where a tavern, a schoolhouse, a church, and a\\nblacksmith\\'s shop constituted the whole settlement, gave as a reason,\\nthat, having to break into the world somewhere, he had chosen the\\nweakest place. He would have tried a new Western city, had they then\\nbeen in fashion, as a still softer spot in the social crust. But this\\nrage for cities in America is prophetic. The name is a spell; and most\\nof the sites, surveyed and distributed into town-lots with squares and\\nparks staked out, are only a century before their time, and will redound\\nto the future credit, however fatal to the immediate cash of their\\nprojectors. Who can doubt that Cairo of Illinois--the standing joke of\\ntourists, (and the standing-water of the Ohio and Mississippi,) though\\nno joke to its founders--will one day rival its Egyptian prototype?\\nAmerica runs to cities, and particularly in its Northern latitudes.\\nAs cities have been the nurses of democratic institutions and ideas,\\ndemocratic nations, for very obvious reasons, tend to produce them. They\\nare the natural fruits of a democracy. And with no people are great\\ncities so important, or likely to be so increasingly populous, as with\\na great agricultural and commercial nation like our own, covered with\\na free and equal population. The vast wealth of such a people, evenly\\ndistributed, and prevented from over-accumulation in special families by\\nthe absence of primogeniture and entail,--their general education\\nand refined tastes,--the intense community of ideas, through the\\nall-pervading influence of a daily press reaching with simultaneous\\ndiffusion over thousands of square miles,--the facilities of\\nlocomotion,--all inevitably cooperate with commercial necessities to\\ncreate great cities,--not merely as the homes of the mercantile and\\nwealthy class, but as centres where the leisure, the tastes, the\\npride, and the wants of the people at large repair more and more for\\nsatisfaction. Free populations, educated in public schools and with an\\nopen career for all, soon instinctively settle the high economies of\\nlife.\\n\\nMany observers have ascribed the rapid change which for twenty years\\npast has been going on in the relative character of towns and villages\\non the one hand, and cities on the other, to the mere operation of the\\nrailroad-system. But that system itself grew out of higher instincts.\\nEqual communities demand equal privileges and advantages. They tend\\nto produce a common level. The country does not acquiesce in the\\nsuperiority of the city in manners, comforts, or luxuries. It demands\\na market at its door,--first-rate men for its advisers in all medical,\\nlegal, moral, and political matters. It demands for itself the\\namusements, the refinements, the privileges of the city. This is to\\nbe brought about only by the application, at any cost, of the most\\nimmediate methods of communication with the city; and behold our\\nrailroad system,--the Briarean shaking of hands which the country gives\\nthe city! The growth of this system is a curious commentary on the\\npurely mercenary policy which is ordinarily supposed to govern the\\ninvestments of capital. The railroads of the United States are as much\\nthe products of social rivalries and the fruits of an ineradicable\\ndemocratic instinct for popularizing all advantages, as of any\\ncommercial emulation. The people have willingly bandaged their own eyes,\\nand allowed themselves to believe a profitable investment was made,\\nbecause their inclinations were so determined to have the roads,\\nprofitable or not. Their wives and daughters _would_ shop in the city;\\nthe choicest sights and sounds were there; there concentrated themselves\\nthe intellectual and moral lights; there were the representative\\nsplendors of the state or nation;--and a swift access to them was\\nessential to true equality and self-respect.\\n\\nOne does not need to be a graybeard to recall the time when every\\ncounty-town in New England had, because it needs must have, its\\nfirst rate lawyer, its distinguished surgeon, its comprehensive\\nbusiness-man,--and when a fixed and unchanging population gave to our\\nvillages a more solid and a more elegant air than they now possess. The\\nConnecticut river-villages, with a considerable increase in population,\\nand a vast improvement in the general character of the dwellings, have\\nnevertheless lost their most characterizing features,--the large and\\ndignified residences of their founders, and the presence of the once\\nable and widely known men that were identified with their local\\nimportance and pride. The railroads have concentrated the ability of all\\nthe professions in the cities, and carried thither the wealth of all the\\nold families. To them, and not to the county-town, repair the people for\\nadvice in all critical matters, for supplies in all important purchases,\\nfor all their rarest pleasures, and all their most prized and memorable\\nopportunities.\\n\\nCities, and the immediate neighborhood of cities, are rapidly becoming\\nthe chosen residences of the enterprising, successful, and intelligent.\\nAs might be supposed, the movement works both ways: the locomotive\\nfacilities carry citizens into the country, as well as countrymen into\\nthe city. But those who have once tasted the city are never wholly\\nweaned from it, and every citizen who moves into a village-community\\nsends two countrymen back to take his place. He infects the country with\\ncivic tastes, and acts as a great conductor between the town and the\\ncountry. It is apparent, too, that the experience of ten years, during\\nwhich some strong reaction upon the centripetal tendencies of the\\nprevious ten years drove many of the wealthy and the self-supposed\\nlovers of quietude and space into the country, has dispersed several\\nvery natural prejudices, and returned the larger part of the truants\\nto their original ways. One of these prejudices was, that our ordinary\\nNorthern climate was as favorable to the outdoor habits of the leisurely\\nclass as the English climate; whereas, besides not having a leisurely\\nclass, and never being destined to have any, under our wise\\nwealth-distributing customs, and not having any out-door habits, which\\ngrow up only on estates and on hereditary fortunes, experience has\\nconvinced most who have tried it that we have only six months when\\nout-of-doors allows any comfort, health, or pleasure away from the city.\\nThe roads are sloughs; side-walks are wanting; shelter is gone with the\\nleaves; non-intercourse is proclaimed; companionship cannot be found;\\nleisure is a drug; books grow stupid; the country is a stupendous bore.\\nAnother prejudice was the anticipated economy of the country. This has\\nturned out to be, as might have been expected, an economy to those who\\nfall in with its ways, which citizens are wholly inapt and unprepared to\\ndo. It is very economical not to want city comforts and conveniences.\\nBut it proves more expensive to those who go into the country to want\\nthem there than it did to have them where they abound. They are not to\\nbe had in the country at any price,--water, gas, fuel, food, attendance,\\namusement, locomotion in all weathers; but such a moderate measure of\\nthem as a city-bred family cannot live without involves so great an\\nexpense, that the expected economy of life in the country to those not\\nactually brought up there turns out a delusion. The expensiveness of\\nlife in the city comes of the generous and grand scale on which it there\\nproceeds, not from the superior cost of the necessaries or comforts of\\nlife. They are undoubtedly cheaper in the city, all things considered,\\nthan anywhere in the country. Where everything is to be had, in the\\nsmallest or the largest quantities,--where every form of service can be\\ncommanded at a moment\\'s notice,--where the wit, skill, competition of a\\ncountry are concentrated upon the furnishing of all commodities at the\\nmost taking rates,--there prices will, of course, be most reasonable;\\nand the expensiveness of such communities, we repeat, is entirely due to\\nthe abundant wealth which makes such enormous demands and secures such\\nvarious comforts and luxuries;--in short, it is the high standard of\\nliving, not the cost of the necessaries of life. This high standard\\nis, of course, an evil to those whose social ambition drives them to a\\nrivalry for which they are not prepared. But no special pity is due to\\nhardships self-imposed by pride and folly. The probability is, that,\\nproportioned to their income from labor, the cost of living in the city,\\nfor the bulk of its population, is lighter, their degree of comfort\\nconsidered, than in the country. And for the wealthy class of society,\\nno doubt, on the whole, economy is served by living in the city. Our\\nmost expensive class is that which lives in the country after the manner\\nof the city.\\n\\nA literary man, of talents and thorough respectability, lately informed\\nus, that, after trying all places, cities, villages, farmhouses,\\nboarding-houses, hotels, taverns, he had discovered that keeping house\\nin New York was the cheapest way to live,--vastly the cheapest, if\\nthe amount of convenience and comfort was considered,--and absolutely\\ncheapest in fact. To be sure, being a bachelor, his housekeeping was\\ndone in a single room, the back-room of a third-story, in a respectable\\nand convenient house and neighborhood. His rent was ninety-six dollars a\\nyear. His expenses of every other kind, (clothing excepted,) one dollar\\na week. He could not get his chop or steak cooked well enough, nor his\\ncoffee made right, until he took them in hand himself,--nor his bed\\nmade, nor his room cleaned. His conveniences were incredibly great. He\\ncooked by alcohol, and expected to warm himself the winter through on\\ntwo gallons of alcohol at seventy-five cents a gallon. This admirable\\nhousekeeping is equalled in economy only by that of a millionnaire, a\\nNew-Yorker, and a bachelor also, whose accounts, all accurately kept by\\nhis own hand, showed, after death, that (1st) his own living, (2d) his\\nsupport of religion, (3d) his charities, (4th) his gifts to a favorite\\nniece, had not averaged, for twenty years, over five hundred dollars.\\nTruly, the city is a cheap place to live in, for those who know how! And\\nwhat place is cheap for those who do not?\\n\\nContrary to the old notion, the more accurate statistics of recent times\\nhave proved the city, as compared with the country, the more healthy,\\nthe more moral, and the more religious place. What used to be considered\\nthe great superiority of the country--hardship, absence of social\\nexcitements and public amusements, simple food, freedom from moral\\nexposure--a better knowledge of the human constitution, considered\\neither physically or morally, has shown to be decidedly opposed to\\nhealth and virtue. More constitutions are broken down in the hardening\\nprocess than survive and profit by it. Cold houses, coarse food\\nunskilfully cooked, long winters, harsh springs, however favorable to\\nthe heroism of the stomach, the lungs, and the spirits, are not found\\nconducive to longevity. In like manner, monotony, seclusion, lack of\\nvariety and of social stimulus lower the tone of humanity, drive to\\nsensual pleasures and secret vices, and nourish a miserable pack of\\nmean and degrading immoralities, of which scandal, gossip, backbiting,\\ntale-bearing are the better examples.\\n\\nIn the Old World, the wealth of states is freely expended in the\\nembellishment of their capitals. It is well understood, not only that\\nloyalty is never more economically secured than by a lavish appeal to\\nthe pride of the citizen in the magnificence of the public buildings\\nand grounds which he identifies with his nationality, but that popular\\nrestlessness is exhaled and dangerous passions drained off in the\\nroominess which parks and gardens afford the common people. In the\\nNew World, it has not yet proved necessary to provide against popular\\ndiscontents or to bribe popular patriotism with spectacles and\\nstate-parade; and if it were so, there is no government with an interest\\nof its own separate from that of the people to adopt this policy. It has\\ntherefore been concluded that democratic institutions must necessarily\\nlack splendor and great public provision for the gratification of the\\naesthetic tastes or the indulgence of the leisure of the common people.\\nThe people being, then, our sovereigns, it has not been felt that they\\nwould or could have the largeness of view, the foresight, the sympathy\\nwith leisure, elegance, and ease, to provide liberally and expensively\\nfor their own recreation and refreshment. A bald utility has been the\\nanticipated genius of our public policy. Our national Mercury was to be\\nsimply the god of the post-office, or the sprite of the barometer,--our\\nPan, to keep the crows from the corn-fields,--our Muses, to preside over\\ndistrict-schools. It begins now to appear that the people are not likely\\nto think anything too good for themselves, or to higgle about the\\nexpense of whatever ministers largely to their tastes and fancies,--that\\npolitical freedom, popular education, the circulation of newspapers,\\nbooks, engravings, pictures, have already created a public which\\nunderstands that man does not live by bread alone,--which demands\\nleisure, beauty, space, architecture, landscape, music, elegance, with\\nan imperative voice, and is ready to back its demands with the necessary\\nself-taxation. This experience our absolute faith in free institutions\\nenabled us to anticipate as the inevitable result of our political\\nsystem; but let us confess that the rapidity with which it has developed\\nitself has taken us by surprise. We knew, that, when the people truly\\nrealized their sovereignty, they would claim not only the utilitarian,\\nbut the artistic and munificent attributes of their throne,--and that\\nall the splendors and decorations, all the provisions for leisure,\\ntaste, and recreation, which kings and courts have made, would be found\\nto be mere preludes and rehearsals to the grander arrangements and\\nachievements of the vastly richer and more legitimate sovereign, the\\nPeople, when he understood his own right and duty. As dynasties and\\nthrones have been predictions of the royalty of the people, so old\\ncourts and old capitals, with all their pomp and circumstance, their\\nparks and gardens, galleries and statues, are but dim prefigurings of\\nthe glories of architecture, the grandeur of the grounds, the splendor\\nand richness of the museums and conservatories with which the people\\nwill finally crown their own self-respect and decorate their own\\nmajesty. But we did not expect to see this sure prophecy turning itself\\ninto history in our day. We thought the people were too busy with the\\nspade and the quill to care for any other sceptres at present. But it\\nis now plain that they have been dreaming princely dreams and thinking\\nroyal thoughts all the while, and are now ready to put them into costly\\nexpression.\\n\\nPassing by all other evidences of this, we come at once to the most\\nmajestic and indisputable witness of this fact, the actual existence\\nof the Central Park in New York,--the most striking evidence of\\nthe sovereignty of the people yet afforded in the history of free\\ninstitutions,--the best answer yet given to the doubts and fears which\\nhave frowned on the theory of self-government,--the first grand proof\\nthat the people do not mean to give up the advantages and victories of\\naristocratic governments, in maintaining a popular one, but to engraft\\nthe energy, foresight, and liberality of concentrated powers upon\\ndemocratic ideas, and keep all that has adorned and improved the past,\\nwhile abandoning what has impaired and disgraced it. That the American\\npeople appreciate and are ready to support what is most elegant,\\nrefined, and beautiful in the greatest capitals of Europe,--that they\\nvalue and intend to provide the largest and most costly opportunities\\nfor the enjoyment of their own leisure, artistic tastes, and rural\\ninstincts, is emphatically declared in the history, progress, and\\nmanifest destiny of the Central Park; while their competency to use\\nwisely, to enjoy peacefully, to protect sacredly, and to improve\\nindustriously the expensive, exposed, and elegant pleasure-ground they\\nhave devised, is proved with redundant testimony by the year and more of\\nexperience we have had in the use of the Park, under circumstances far\\nless favorable than any that can ever again arise. As a test of the\\nability of the people to know their own higher wants, of the power of\\ntheir artistic instincts, their docility to the counsels of their most\\njudicious representatives, their superiority to petty economies, their\\nstrength to resist the natural opposition of heavy tax-payers to\\nexpensive public works, their gentleness and amenableness to just\\nauthority in the pursuit of their pleasures, of their susceptibility to\\nthe softening influences of elegance and beauty, of their honest pride\\nand rejoicing in their own splendor, of their superior fondness for what\\nis innocent and elevating over what is base and degrading, when\\nbrought within equal reach, the Central Park has already afforded most\\nencouraging, nay, most decisive proof.\\n\\nThe Central Park is an anomaly to those who have not deeply studied the\\ntendencies of popular governments. It is a royal work, undertaken and\\nachieved by the Democracy,--surprising equally themselves and their\\nskeptical friends at home and abroad,--and developing, both in its\\ncreation and growth, in its use and application, new and almost\\nincredible tastes, aptitudes, capacities, and powers in the people\\nthemselves. That the people should be capable of the magnanimity of\\nlaying down their authority, when necessary to concentrate it in\\nthe hands of energetic and responsible trustees requiring large\\npowers,--that they should be willing to tax themselves heavily for the\\nbenefit of future generations,--that they should be wise enough to\\ndistrust their own judgment and defer modestly to the counsels of\\nexperts,--that they should be in favor of the most solid and substantial\\nwork,--that they should be willing to have the better half of their\\nmoney under ground and out of sight, invested in drains and foundations\\nof roads,--that they should acquiesce cheerfully in all the restrictions\\nnecessary to the achievement of the work, while admitted freely to the\\nuse and enjoyment of its inchoate processes,--that their conduct and\\nmanners should prove so unexceptionable,--their disposition to trespass\\nupon strict rules so small,--their use and improvement of the work so\\nfree, so easy, and so immediately justificatory of all the cost of so\\ngenerous and grand an enterprise: these things throw light and cheer\\nupon the prospects of popular institutions, at a period when they are\\nseriously clouded from other quarters.\\n\\nWe do not propose to enter into any description of the Central Park.\\nThose who have not already visited it will find a description,\\naccompanying a study for the plan submitted for competition in 1858, by\\nMessrs. Olmsted and Vaux, and published among the Documents of the New\\nYork Senate, which will satisfy their utmost expectations. We wish\\nmerely to throw out some replies to the leading objections we have met\\nin the papers and other quarters to the plan itself. We need hardly say\\nthat the Central Park requires no advocate and no defence. Its great\\nproprietor, the Public, is perfectly satisfied with his purchase and his\\nagents. He thinks himself providentially guided in the choice of his\\nSuperintendent, and does not vainly pique himself upon his sagacity in\\nselecting Mr. Frederick Law Olmsted for the post. This gentleman, in his\\nplace, offsets at least a thousand square plugs in round holes. He is\\nprecisely the man for the place,--and that is precisely the place for\\nthe man. Among final causes, it would be difficult not to assign the\\nCentral Park as the reason of his existence. To fill the duties of his\\noffice as he has filled them,--to prove himself equally competent as\\noriginal designer, patient executor, potent disciplinarian, and model\\npolice-officer,--to enforce a method, precision, and strictness, equally\\nmarked in the workmanship, in the accounts, and in the police of the\\nPark,--to be equally studious of the highest possible use and enjoyment\\nof the work by the public of to-day, and of the prospects and privileges\\nof the coming generations,--to sympathize with the outside people,\\nwhile in the closest fellowship with the inside,--to make himself\\nequally the favorite and friend of the people and of the workmen:\\nthis proves an original adaptation, most carefully improved, which we\\nseriously believe not capable of being paralleled in any other public\\nwork, of similar magnitude, ever undertaken. The union of prosaic\\nsense with poetical feeling, of democratic sympathies with refined\\nand scholarly tastes, of punctilious respect for facts with tender\\nhospitality for ideas, has enabled him to appreciate and embody, both in\\nthe conception and execution of the Park, the beau-ideal of a people\\'s\\npleasure-ground. If he had not borne, as an agriculturist, and as the\\nkeenest, most candid, and instructive of all our writers on the moral\\nand political economy of our American Slavery, a name to be long\\nremembered, he might safely trust his reputation to the keeping of New\\nYork city and all her successive citizens, as the author and achiever of\\nthe Central Park,--which, when completed, will prove, we are confident,\\nthe most splendid, satisfactory, and popular park in the world.\\n\\nTwo grand assumptions have controlled the design from the inception.\\n\\nFirst, That the Park would be the only park deserving the name, for a\\ntown of twice or thrice the present population of New York; that\\nthis town would be built compactly around it (and in this respect\\nof centrality it would differ from any extant metropolitan park of\\nmagnitude); and that it would be a town of greater wealth and more\\nluxurious demands than any now existing.\\n\\nSecond, That, while in harmony with the luxury of the rich, the Park\\nshould and would be used more than any existing park by people of\\nmoderate wealth and by poor people, and that its use by these people\\nmust be made safe, convenient, agreeable; that they must be expected\\nto have a pride and pleasure in using it rightly, in cherishing and\\nprotecting it against all causes of injury and dilapidation, and that\\nthis is to be provided for and encouraged.\\n\\nA want of appreciation of the first assumption is the cause of all\\nsincere criticism against the Transverse Roads. Some engineers\\noriginally pronounced them impracticable of construction; but all their\\ngrounds of apprehension have been removed by the construction of two of\\nthem, especially by the completion of the tunnel under Vista Rock, and\\nbelow the foundation of the Reservoir embankment and wall. They were\\nplanned for the future; they are being built solidly, massively,\\npermanently, for the future. Less thoroughly and expensively\\nconstructed, they would need to be rebuilt in the future at enormously\\nincreased cost, and with great interruption to the use of the Park; and\\nthe grounds in their vicinity, losing the advantage of age, would need\\nto be remodelled and remade. An engineer, visiting the Park for the\\nfirst time, and hearing the criticism to which we refer applied to the\\nwalls and bridges of the Transverse Roads, observed,--\"People in this\\ncountry are so unaccustomed to see genuine substantial work, they do not\\nknow what it means when they meet with it.\" We think he did not do the\\npeople justice.\\n\\nThe Transverse Roads passing through the Park will not be seen from\\nit; and although they will not be, when deep in the shadow of the\\noverhanging bridges and groves, without a very grand beauty, this will\\nbe the beauty of utility and of permanence, not of imaginative grace.\\nThe various bridges and archways of the Park proper, while equally\\nthorough in their mode of construction, and consequently expensive,\\nare in all cases embellished each with special decorations in form and\\ncolor. These decorations have the same quality of substantiality and\\nthorough good workmanship. Note the clean under-cutting of the leaves,\\n(of which there are more than fifty different forms in the decorations\\nof the Terrace arch,) and their consequent sharp and expressive shadows.\\nAdmitting the need of these structures, and the economy of a method of\\nconstruction which would render them permanent, the additional cost of\\ntheir permanent decoration in this way could not have been rationally\\ngrudged.\\n\\nRegard for the distant future has likewise controlled the planting; and\\nthe Commissioners, in so far as they have resisted the clamor of the\\nday, that the Park must be immediately shaded, have done wisely. Every\\nhorticulturist knows that this immediate shade would be purchased at an\\nexpense of dwarfed, diseased, and deformed trees, with stinted shade, in\\nthe future. No man has planted large and small trees together without\\nregretting the former within twenty years. The same consideration\\nanswers an objection which has been made, that the trees are too much\\narranged in masses of color. Imagine a growth of twenty years, with the\\nproper thinnings, and most of these masses will resolve each into one\\ntree, singled out, as the best individual of its mass, to remain. There\\nis a large scale in the planting, as in everything else.\\n\\nRegard to the convenience, comfort, and safety of those who cannot\\nafford to visit the Park in carriages has led to an unusual extent and\\nvariety of character in the walks, and also to a peculiar arrangement by\\nwhich they are carried in many instances beneath and across the line of\\nthe carriage-roads. Thus access can be had by pedestrians to all parts\\nof the Park at times when the roads are thronged with vehicles, without\\nany delays or dangers in crossing the roads, and without the humiliation\\nto sensitive democrats of being spattered or dusted, or looked down upon\\nfrom luxurious equipages.\\n\\nThe great irregularity of the surface offers facilities for this\\npurpose,--the walks being carried through the heads of valleys which are\\ncrossed by the carriage-ways upon arches of masonry. Now with regard to\\nthese archways, if no purposes of convenience were to be served by them,\\nthe Park would not, we may admit, be beautified by them. But we assume\\nthat the population of New York is to be doubled; that, when it is so,\\nif not sooner, the walks and drives of the Park will often be densely\\nthronged; and, for the comfort of the people, when that shall be the\\ncase, we consider that these archways will be absolutely necessary.[A]\\nAssuming further, then, that they are to be built, and, if ever, built\\nnow,--since it would involve an entirely new-modelling of the Park to\\nintroduce them in the future,--it was necessary to pay some attention to\\nmake them agreeable and unmonotonous objects, or the general impression\\nof ease, freedom, and variety would be interfered with very materially.\\nIt is not to make the Park architectural, as is commonly supposed, that\\nvarious and somewhat expensive _design_ is introduced; on the contrary,\\nit is the intention to plant closely in the vicinity of all the arches,\\nso that they may be unnoticed in the general effect, and be seen only\\njust at the time they are being used, when, of course, they must come\\nunder notice. The charge is made, that the features of the natural\\nlandscape have been disregarded in the plan. To which we answer, that on\\nthe ground of the Lower Park there was originally no landscape, in the\\nartistic sense. There were hills, and hillocks, and rocks, and swampy\\nvalleys. It would have been easy to flood the swamps into ponds, to\\nclothe the hillocks with grass and the hills with foliage, and leave the\\nrocks each unscathed in its picturesqueness. And this would have been a\\ngreat improvement; yet there would be no landscape: there would be\\nan unassociated succession of objects,--many nice \"bits\" of scenery,\\nappropriate to a villa-garden or to an artist\\'s sketch-book, but no\\nscenery such as an artist arranges for his broad canvas, no composition,\\nno _park-like_ prospect. It would have afforded a good place for\\nloitering; but if this were all that was desirable, forty acres would\\nhave done as well as a thousand, as is shown in the Ramble. Space,\\nbreadth, objects in the distance, clear in outline, but obscure,\\nmysterious, exciting curiosity, in their detail, were wanting.\\n\\n[Footnote A: The length of roads, walks, etc., completed, will be found\\nin the last Annual Report, pp. 47-52.\\n\\nThe length of the famous drive in Hyde Park (the King Road) is 2 1/2\\nmiles. There is another road, straight between two gates, 1 1/4 miles in\\nlength. \"Rotten Bow\" (the Ride) is a trifle over a mile in length.\\n\\nThe length of Drive in Central Park will be 9 1/3 miles; the length of\\nBridle Roads, 5 1/3 miles; the length of Walks, 20 miles.\\n\\nTen miles of walk, gravelled and substantially underlaid, are now\\nfinished.\\n\\nEighteen archways are planned, beside those of the Transverse Roads,\\nequal 1 to 46 acres. When the planting is well-grown, no two of the\\narchways will be visible from the same point.]\\n\\nTo their supply there were hard limitations. On each side, within half\\na mile of each other, there were to be lines of stone and brick houses,\\ncutting off any great lateral distance. Suppose one to have entered\\nthe Park at the south end, and to have moved far enough within it to\\ndispossess his mind of the sentiments of the streets: he will have\\nthreaded his way between hillocks and rocks, one after another,\\ndiffering in magnitude, but never opening a landscape having breadth or\\ndistance. He ascends a hill and looks northward: the most distant\\nobject is the hard, straight, horizontal line of the stone wall of the\\nReservoir, flanked on one side by the peak of Vista Rock. It is a little\\nover a mile distant,--but, standing clear out against the horizon,\\nappears much less than that. Hide it with foliage, as well as the houses\\nright and left, and the limitation of distance is a mile in front and a\\nquarter of a mile upon each side. Low hills or ridges of rock in a great\\ndegree cut off the intermediate ground from view: cross these, and the\\nsame unassociated succession of objects might be visited, but no one of\\nthem would have engaged the visitor\\'s attention and attracted him onward\\nfrom a distance. The plan has evidently been to make a selection of\\nthe natural features to form the leading ideas of the new scenery, to\\nmagnify the most important quality of each of these, and to remove or\\ntone down all the irregularities of the ground between them, and by all\\nmeans to make the limit of vision undefined and obscure. Thus, in the\\ncentral portion of the Lower Park the low grounds have been generally\\nfilled, and the high grounds reduced; but the two largest areas of low\\nground have been excavated, the excavation being carried laterally into\\nthe hills as far as was possible, without extravagant removal of rock,\\nand the earth obtained transferred to higher ground connecting hillocks\\nwith hills. Excavations have also been made about the base of all the\\nmore remarkable ledges and peaks of rock, while additional material has\\nbeen conveyed to their sides and summits to increase their size and\\ndignity.\\n\\nThis general rule of the plan was calculated to give, in the first\\nplace, breadth, and, in the second, emphasis, to any general prospect\\nof the Park. A want of unity, or rather, if we may use the word, of\\nassemblage, belonged to the ground; and it must have been one of the\\nfirst problems to establish some one conspicuous, salient idea which\\nshould take the lead in the composition, and about which all minor\\nfeatures should seem naturally to group as accessories. The straight,\\nevidently artificial, and hence distinctive and notable, Mall, with its\\nterminating Terrace, was the resolution of this problem. It will be,\\nwhen the trees are fully grown, a feature of the requisite importance,\\n--and will serve the further purpose of opening the view toward, and, as\\nit were, framing and keeping attention directed upon, Vista Rock, which\\nfrom the southern end of the Mall is the most distant object that can be\\nbrought into view.\\n\\nFor the same purpose, evidently, it was thought desirable to insist,\\nas far as possible, upon a pause at the point where, to the visitor\\nproceeding northward, the whole hill-side and glen before Vista Rock\\nfirst came under view, and where an effect of distance in that direction\\nwas yet attainable. This is provided for by the Terrace, with its\\nseveral stairs and stages, and temptations to linger and rest. The\\nintroduction of the Lake to the northward of the Terrace also obliges a\\ndiversion from the direct line of proceeding; the visitor\\'s attention is\\nhenceforth directed laterally, or held by local objects, until at length\\nby a circuitous route he reaches and ascends (if he chooses) the summit\\nof Vista Rock, when a new landscape of entirely different character, and\\none not within our control, is opened to him. Thus the apparent distance\\nof Vista Rock from the lower part of the Park (which is increased\\nby means which we have not thought it necessary to describe) is not\\nfalsified by any experience of the visitor in his subsequent journey to\\nit.\\n\\nThere was a fine and completely natural landscape in the Upper Park. The\\nplan only simplifies it,--removing and modifying those objects which\\nwere incongruous with its best predominating character, and here and\\nthere adding emphasis or shadow.\\n\\nThe Park (with the extension) is two and three quarter miles in length\\nand nearly half a mile wide. It contains 843 acres, including the\\nReservoir (136 acres).\\n\\n  Original cost of land to 106th Street,             $5,444,369.90\\n  Of this, assessed on adjoining property,            1,657,590.00\\n                                                      ____________\\n  To be paid by corporation direct,                   3,786,779.90\\n  Assessed value of extension land, (106th to 110th,) 1,400,000.00\\n                                                      ____________\\n  Total cost of land,                                $6,800,000.00[B]\\n\\n[Footnote B: The amount thus far expended in construction and\\nmaintenance is nearly $3,000,000. The plan upon which the work is\\nproceeding will require a further expenditure of $1,600,000. The\\nexpenditure is not squandered. Much the larger part of it is paid for\\nday-labor. Account with laborers is kept by the hour, the rate of wages\\nbeing scarcely above the lowest contractor\\'s rates, and 30 per cent.\\nbelow the rate of other public works of the city; always paid directly\\ninto the laborer\\'s hands,--in specie, however.\\n\\nThe thorough government of the work, and the general efficiency of its\\ndirection, are indicated by the remarkable good order and absence of\\n\"accidents\" which have characterized it.

For some particulars of cost, see pp. 61, 62, of same Report.]\\n\\nIn all European parks, there is more or less land the only use of which\\nis to give a greater length to the roads which pass around it,--it being\\nout of sight, and, in American phrase, unimproved. There is not an acre\\nof land in Central Park, which, if not wanted for Park purposes, would\\nnot sell for at least as much as the land surrounding the Park and\\nbeyond its limits,--that is to say, for at least $60,000, the legal\\nannual interest of which is $4,200. This would be the ratio of the\\nannual waste of property in the case of any land not put to use; but,\\nin elaborating the plan, care has been taken that no part of the Park\\nshould be without its special advantages, attractions, or valuable uses,\\nand that these should as far as possible be made immediately available\\nto the public.\\n\\nThe comprehensiveness of purpose and the variety of detail of the plan\\nfar exceed those of any other park in the world, and have involved, and\\ncontinue to involve, a greater amount of study and invention than has\\never before been given to a park. A consideration of this should enforce\\nan unusually careful method of maintenance, both in the gardening and\\npolice departments. Sweeping with a broom of brush-wood once a week is\\nwell enough for a hovel; but the floors of a palace must needs be daily\\nwaxed and polished, to justify their original cost. We are unused to\\nthorough gardening in this country. There are not in all the United\\nStates a dozen lawns or grass-plots so well kept as the majority of\\ntradesmen\\'s door-yards in England or Holland. Few of our citizens have\\never seen a really well-kept ground. During the last summer, much of the\\nPark was in a state of which the Superintendent professed himself to be\\nashamed; but it caused not the slightest comment with the public, so far\\nas we heard. As nearly all men in office, who have not a personal taste\\nto satisfy, are well content, if they succeed in satisfying the public,\\nwe fear the Superintendent will be forced to \"economize\" on the keeping\\nof the Park, as he was the past year, to a degree which will be as far\\nfrom true economy as the cleaning of mosaic floors with birch brooms.\\nThe Park is laid out in a manner which assumes and requires cleanly and\\norderly habits in those who use it; much of its good quality will be\\nlost, if it be not very neatly kept; and such negligence in the keeping\\nwill tend to negligence in the using.\\n\\nIn the plan, there is taken for granted a generally good inclination, a\\ncleanly, temperate, orderly disposition, on the part of the public which\\nis to frequent the Park, and finally to be the governors of its keeping,\\nand a good, well-disposed, and well-disciplined police force, who would,\\nin spite of \"the inabilities of a republic,\" adequately control the\\ncases exceptional to the assumed general good habits of that public,--at\\nthe same time neglecting no precaution to facilitate the convenient\\nenforcement of the laws, and reduce the temptation to disorderly\\npractices to a minimum.\\n\\nHow thoroughly justified has been this confidence in the people, taking\\ninto account the novelty of a good public ground, of cleanliness in our\\npublic places, and indeed the novelty of the whole undertaking, we have\\nalready intimated. How much the privileges of the Park in its present\\nincomplete condition are appreciated, and how generally the requirements\\nof order are satisfied, the following summary, compiled from the\\nPark-keeper\\'s reports of the first summer\\'s use after the roads of the\\nLower Park were opened, will inadequately show.\\n\\n  Number of visitors in six months.

Of these, twenty-four were sufficiently drunk to justify\\ntheir arrest,--the remainder going quietly off the grounds, when\\nrequested to do so. That is to say, it is not oftener than once a week\\nthat a man is observed to be the worse for liquor while on the Park; and\\nthis, while three to four thousand laboring men are at work within it,\\nare paid upon it, and grog-shops for their accommodation are all along\\nits boundaries. In other words, about one in thirty thousand of the\\nvisitors to the Park has been under the influence of drink when induced\\nto visit it.\\n\\nOn Christmas and New-Year\\'s Days, it was estimated by many experienced\\nreporters that over 100,000 persons, each day, were on the Park,\\ngenerally in a frolicksome mood. Of these, but one (a small boy) was\\nobserved by the keepers to be drunk; there was not an instance of\\nquarrelling, and no disorderly conduct, except a generally good-natured\\nresistance to the efforts of the police to maintain safety on the ice.\\n\\nThe Bloomingdale Road and Harlem Lane, two famous trotting-courses,\\nwhere several hundred famously fast horses may be seen at the top of\\ntheir speed any fine afternoon, both touch an entrance to the Park. The\\nPark roads are, of course, vastly attractive to the trotters, and for\\na few weeks there were daily instances of fast driving there: as soon,\\nhowever, as the law and custom of the Park, restricting speed to a\\nmoderate rate, could be made generally understood, fast driving became\\nvery rare,--more so, probably, than in Hyde Park or the Bois de\\nBoulogne. As far as possible, an arrest has been made in every case\\nof intentionally fast driving observed by the keepers: those arrested\\nnumber less than one to ten thousand of the vehicles entering the Park\\nfor pleasure-driving. In each case a fine (usually three dollars) has\\nbeen imposed by the magistrate.\\n\\nIn six months there have been sixty-four arrests for all sorts of\\n\"disorderly conduct,\" including walking on the grass after being\\nrequested to quit it, quarrelling, firing crackers, etc.,--one in\\neighteen thousand visitors. So thoroughly established is the good\\nconduct of people on the Park, that many ladies walk daily in the Ramble\\nwithout attendance.\\n\\nA protest, as already intimated, is occasionally made against the\\ncompleteness of detail to which the Commissioners are disposed to\\ncarry their work, on the ground that the habits of the masses of our\\ncity-population are ill-calculated for its appreciation, and that loss\\nand damage to expensive work must often be the result. To which we\\nwould answer, that, if the authorities of the city hitherto have so far\\nmisapprehended or neglected their duty as to allow a large industrious\\npopulation to continue so long without the opportunity for public\\nrecreations that it has grown up ignorant of the rights and duties\\nappertaining to the general use of a well-kept pleasure-ground, any\\nlosses of the kind apprehended, which may in consequence occur, should\\nbe cheerfully borne as a necessary part of the responsibility of a\\ngood government. Experience thus far, however, does not justify these\\napprehensions.\\n\\nTo collect exact evidence showing that the Park is already exercising a\\ngood influence upon the character of the people is not in the nature of\\nthe case practicable. It has been observed that rude, noisy fellows,\\nafter entering the more advanced or finished parts of the Park, become\\nhushed, moderate, and careful. Observing the generally tranquil and\\npleased expression, and the quiet, sauntering movement, the frequent\\nexclamations of pleasure in the general view or in the sight of some\\nspecial object of natural beauty, on the part of the crowds of idlers in\\nthe Ramble on a Sunday afternoon, and recollecting the totally opposite\\ncharacter of feeling, thought, purpose, and sentiment which is expressed\\nby a crowd assembled anywhere else, especially in the public streets of\\nthe city, the conviction cannot well be avoided that the Park already\\nexercises a beneficent influence of no inconsiderable value, and of a\\nkind which could have been gained in no other way. We speak of Sunday\\nafternoons and of a crowd; but the Park evidently does induce many a\\npoor family, and many a poor seamstress and journeyman, to take a day or\\na half-day from the working-time of the week, to the end of retaining\\ntheir youth and their youthful relations with purer Nature, and to their\\ngain in strength, good-humor, safe citizenship, and--if the economists\\nmust be satisfied--money-value to the commonwealth. Already, too, there\\nare several thousand men, women, and children who resort to the Park\\nhabitually: some daily, before business or after business, and women\\nand children at regular hours during the day; some weekly; and some at\\nirregular, but certain frequent chances of their business. Mr. Astor,\\nwhen in town, rarely misses his daily ride; nor Mr. Bancroft; Mr. Mayor\\nHarper never his drive. And there are certain working-men with their\\nfamilies equally sure to be met walking on Sunday morning or Sunday\\nafternoon; others on Saturday. The number of these _habitues_ constantly\\nincreases. When we meet those who depend on the Park as on the butcher\\nand the omnibus, and the thousands who are again drawn by whatever\\nimpulse and suggestion of the hour, we often ask, What would they have\\ndone, where would they have been, to what sort of recreation would they\\nhave turned, _if to any_, had there been no park? Of one sort the answer\\nis supplied by the keeper of a certain saloon, who came to the Park, as\\nhe said, to see his old Sunday customers. The enjoyment of the ice had\\nmade them forget their grog.\\n\\nSix or seven years ago, an opposition brought down the prices and\\nquadrupled the accommodations of the Staten Island ferry-boats. Clifton\\nPark and numerous German gardens were opened; and the consequence was\\ndescribed, in common phrase, as the transformation of a portion of the\\nisland, on Sunday, to a Pandemonium. We thought we would, like Dante,\\nhave a cool look at it. We had read so much about it, and heard it\\ntalked about and preached about so much, that we were greatly surprised\\nto find the throng upon the sidewalks quite as orderly and a great deal\\nmore evidently good-natured than any we ever saw before in the United\\nStates. We spent some time in what we had been led to suppose the\\nhottest place, Clifton Park, in which there was a band of music and\\nseveral thousand persons, chiefly Germans, though with a good sprinkling\\nof Irish servant-girls with their lovers and brothers, with beer\\nand ices; but we saw no rudeness, and no more impropriety, no more\\nexcitement, no more (week-day) sin, than we had seen at the church in\\nthe morning. Every face, however, was foreign. By-and-by came in three\\nAmericans, talking loudly, moving rudely, proclaiming contempt for\\n\"lager\" and yelling for \"liquor,\" bantering and offering fight, joking\\ncoarsely, profane, noisy, demonstrative in any and every way, to the end\\nof attracting attention to themselves, and proclaiming that they were\\n\"on a spree\" and highly excited. They could not keep it up; they became\\nawkward, ill at ease, and at length silent, standing looking about them\\nin stupid wonder. Evidently they could not understand what it meant:\\npeople drinking, smoking in public, on Sunday, and yet not excited, not\\ntrying to make it a spree. It was not comprehensible. We ascertained\\nthat one of the ferry-boat bars had disposed of an enormous stock of\\nlemonade, ginger-beer, and soda-water before three o\\'clock,--but, till\\nthis was all gone, not half a dozen glasses of intoxicating drinks.\\nWe saw no quarrelling, no drunkenness, and nothing like the fearful\\ndisorder which had been described,--with a few such exceptions as we\\nhave mentioned of native Americans who had no conception of enjoyment\\nfree from bodily excitement.\\n\\nTo teach and induce habits of orderly, tranquil, contemplative, or\\nsocial amusement, moderate exercises and recreation, soothing to the\\nnerves, has been the most needed \"mission\" for New York. We think we\\nsee daily evidence that the Park accomplishes not a little in this way.\\nUnfortunately, the evidence is not of a character to be expressed in\\nFederal currency, else the Commissioners would not be hesitating about\\ntaking the ground from One-Hundred-and-Sixth to One-Hundred-and-Tenth\\nStreet, because it is to cost half a million more than was anticipated.\\nWhat the Park is worth to us to-day is, we trust, but a trifle to what\\nit will be worth when the bulk of our hard-working people, of our\\nover-anxious Marthas, and our gutter-skating children shall live nearer\\nto it, and more generally understand what it offers them,--when its\\nplay-grounds are ready, its walks more shaded,--when cheap and wholesome\\nmeals, to the saving, occasionally, of the dreary housewife\\'s daily\\npottering, are to be had upon it,--when its system of cheap cabs shall\\nhave been successfully inaugurated,--and when a daily discourse of sweet\\nsounds shall have been made an essential part of its functions in the\\nbody-politic.\\n\\nWe shall not probably live to see \"the gentility of Sir Philip Sidney\\nmade universal,\" but we do hope that we shall live to know many\\nresidents of towns of ten thousand population who will be ashamed to\\nsubscribe for the building of new churches while no public play-ground\\nis being prepared for their people.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLIFE IN THE IRON-MILLS.\\n\\n  \"Is this the end?\\n  O Life, as futile, then, as frail!\\n  What hope of answer or redress?\"\\n\\n\\nA cloudy day: do you know what that is in a town of iron-works? The sky\\nsank down before dawn, muddy, flat, immovable. The air is thick, clammy\\nwith the breath of crowded human beings. It stifles me. I open the\\nwindow, and, looking out, can scarcely see through the rain the grocer\\'s\\nshop opposite, where a crowd of drunken Irishmen are puffing Lynchburg\\ntobacco in their pipes. I can detect the scent through all the foul\\nsmells ranging loose in the air.\\n\\nThe idiosyncrasy of this town is smoke. It rolls sullenly in slow folds\\nfrom the great chimneys of the iron-foundries, and settles down in\\nblack, slimy pools on the muddy streets. Smoke on the wharves, smoke on\\nthe dingy boats, on the yellow river,--clinging in a coating of greasy\\nsoot to the house-front, the two faded poplars, the faces of the\\npassers-by. The long train of mules, dragging masses of pig-iron through\\nthe narrow street, have a foul vapor hanging to their reeking sides.\\nHere, inside, is a little broken figure of an angel pointing upward from\\nthe mantel-shelf; but even its wings are covered with smoke, clotted\\nand black. Smoke everywhere! A dirty canary chirps desolately in a\\ncage beside me. Its dream of green fields and sunshine is a very old\\ndream,--almost worn out, I think.\\n\\nFrom the back-window I can see a narrow brick-yard sloping down to\\nthe river-side, strewed with rain-butts and tubs. The river, dull and\\ntawny-, _(la belle riviere!)_ drags itself sluggishly along,\\ntired of the heavy weight of boats and coal-barges. What wonder? When I\\nwas a child, I used to fancy a look of weary, dumb appeal upon the face\\nof the <DW64>-like river slavishly bearing its burden day after day.\\nSomething of the same idle notion comes to me to-day, when from the\\nstreet-window I look on the slow stream of human life creeping past,\\nnight and morning, to the great mills. Masses of men, with dull,\\nbesotted faces bent to the ground, sharpened here and there by pain\\nor cunning; skin and muscle and flesh begrimed with smoke and ashes;\\nstooping all night over boiling caldrons of metal, laired by day in\\ndens of drunkenness and infamy; breathing from infancy to death an air\\nsaturated with fog and grease and soot, vileness for soul and body. What\\ndo you make of a case like that, amateur psychologist? You call it an\\naltogether serious thing to be alive: to these men it is a drunken jest,\\na joke,--horrible to angels perhaps, to them commonplace enough. My\\nfancy about the river was an idle one: it is no type of such a life.\\nWhat if it be stagnant and slimy here? It knows that beyond there waits\\nfor it odorous sunlight,--quaint old gardens, dusky with soft, green\\nfoliage of apple-trees, and flushing crimson with roses,--air, and\\nfields, and mountains. The future of the Welsh puddler passing just now\\nis not so pleasant. To be stowed away, after his grimy work is done, in\\na hole in the muddy graveyard, and after that,--_not_ air, nor green\\nfields, nor curious roses.\\n\\nCan you see how foggy the day is? As I stand here, idly tapping the\\nwindow-pane, and looking out through the rain at the dirty back-yard and\\nthe coal-boats below, fragments of an old story float up before me,--a\\nstory of this old house into which I happened to come to-day. You may\\nthink it a tiresome story enough, as foggy as the day, sharpened by no\\nsudden flashes of pain or pleasure.--I know: only the outline of a dull\\nlife, that long since, with thousands of dull lives like its own, was\\nvainly lived and lost: thousands of them,--massed, vile, slimy lives,\\nlike those of the torpid lizards in yonder stagnant water-butt.--Lost?\\nThere is a curious point for you to settle, my friend, who study\\npsychology in a lazy, _dilettante_ way. Stop a moment. I am going to be\\nhonest. This is what I want you to do. I want you to hide your disgust,\\ntake no heed to your clean clothes, and come right down with me,--here,\\ninto the thickest of the fog and mud and foul effluvia. I want you to\\nhear this story. There is a secret down here, in this nightmare fog,\\nthat has lain dumb for centuries: I want to make it a real thing to you.\\nYou, Egoist, or Pantheist, or Arminian, busy in making straight paths\\nfor your feet on the hills, do not see it clearly,--this terrible\\nquestion which men here have gone mad and died trying to answer. I dare\\nnot put this secret into words. I told you it was dumb. These men, going\\nby with drunken faces and brains full of unawakened power, do not ask it\\nof Society or of God. Their lives ask it; their deaths ask it. There is\\nno reply. I will tell you plainly that I have a great hope; and I bring\\nit to you to be tested. It is this: that this terrible dumb question is\\nits own reply; that it is not the sentence of death we think it, but,\\nfrom the very extremity of its darkness, the most solemn prophecy which\\nthe world has known of the Hope to come. I dare make my meaning no\\nclearer, but will only tell my story. It will, perhaps, seem to you as\\nfoul and dark as this thick vapor about us, and as pregnant with death;\\nbut if your eyes are free as mine are to look deeper, no perfume-tinted\\ndawn will be so fair with promise of the day that shall surely come.\\n\\nMy story is very simple,--only what I remember of the life of one\\nof these men,--a furnace-tender in one of Kirby & John\\'s\\nrolling-mills,--Hugh Wolfe. You know the mills? They took the great\\norder for the Lower Virginia railroads there last winter; run usually\\nwith about a thousand men. I cannot tell why I choose the half-forgotten\\nstory of this Wolfe more than that of myriads of these furnace-hands.\\nPerhaps because there is a secret underlying sympathy between that story\\nand this day with its impure fog and thwarted sunshine,--or perhaps\\nsimply for the reason that this house is the one where the Wolfes lived.\\nThere were the father and son,--both hands, as I said, in one of Kirby\\n& John\\'s mills for making railroad-iron,--and Deborah, their cousin, a\\npicker in some of the cotton-mills. The house was rented then to half\\na dozen families. The Wolfes had two of the cellar-rooms. The old man,\\nlike many of the puddlers and feeders of the mills, was Welsh,--had\\nspent half of his life in the Cornish tin-mines. You may pick the Welsh\\nemigrants, Cornish miners, out of the throng passing the windows, any\\nday. They are a trifle more filthy; their muscles are not so brawny;\\nthey stoop more. When they are drunk, they neither yell, nor shout, nor\\nstagger, but skulk along like beaten hounds. A pure, unmixed blood, I\\nfancy: shows itself in the slight angular bodies and sharply-cut facial\\nlines. It is nearly thirty years since the Wolfes lived here. Their\\nlives were like those of their class: incessant labor, sleeping in\\nkennel-like rooms, eating rank pork and molasses, drinking--God and the\\ndistillers only know what; with an occasional night in jail, to atone\\nfor some drunken excess. Is that all of their lives?--of the portion\\ngiven to them and these their duplicates swarming the streets to-day?\\n--nothing beneath?--all? So many a political reformer will tell\\nyou,--and many a private reformer, too, who has gone among them with a\\nheart tender with Christ\\'s charity, and come out outraged, hardened.\\n\\nOne rainy night, about eleven o\\'clock, a crowd of half-clothed women\\nstopped outside of the cellar-door. They were going home from the\\ncotton-mill.\\n\\n\"Good-night, Deb,\" said one, a mulatto, steadying herself against the\\ngas-post. She needed the post to steady her. So did more than one of\\nthem.\\n\\n\"Dah\\'s a ball to Miss Potts\\' to-night. Ye\\'d best come.\"\\n\\n\"Inteet, Deb, if hur \\'ll come, hur \\'ll hef fun,\" said a shrill Welsh\\nvoice in the crowd.\\n\\nTwo or three dirty hands were thrust out to catch the gown of the woman,\\nwho was groping for the latch of the door.\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"No? Where\\'s Kit Small, then?\"\\n\\n\"Begorra! on the spools. Alleys behint, though we helped her, we dud.\\nAn wid ye! Let Deb alone! It\\'s ondacent frettin\\' a quite body. Be\\nthe powers, an\\' we\\'ll have a night of it! there\\'ll be lashin\\'s o\\'\\ndrink,--the Vargent be blessed and praised for \\'t!\"\\n\\nThey went on, the mulatto inclining for a moment to show fight, and drag\\nthe woman Wolfe off with them; but, being pacified, she staggered away.\\n\\nDeborah groped her way into the cellar, and, after considerable\\nstumbling, kindled a match, and lighted a tallow dip, that sent a yellow\\nglimmer over the room. It was low, damp,--the earthen floor covered with\\na green, slimy moss,--a fetid air smothering the breath. Old Wolfe lay\\nasleep on a heap of straw, wrapped in a torn horse-blanket. He was a\\npale, meek little man, with a white face and red rabbit-eyes. The woman\\nDeborah was like him; only her face was even more ghastly, her lips\\nbluer, her eyes more watery. She wore a faded cotton gown and a\\nslouching bonnet. When she walked, one could see that she was deformed,\\nalmost a hunchback. She trod softly, so as not to waken him, and went\\nthrough into the room beyond. There she found by the half-extinguished\\nfire an iron saucepan filled with cold boiled potatoes, which she put\\nupon a broken chair with a pint-cup of ale. Placing the old candlestick\\nbeside this dainty repast, she untied her bonnet, which hung limp and\\nwet over her face, and prepared to eat her supper. It was the first\\nfood that had touched her lips since morning. There was enough of it,\\nhowever: there is not always. She was hungry,--one could see that easily\\nenough,--and not drunk, as most of her companions would have been found\\nat this hour. She did not drink, this woman,--her face told that,\\ntoo,--nothing stronger than ale. Perhaps the weak, flaccid wretch had\\nsome stimulant in her pale life to keep her up,--some love or hope, it\\nmight be, or urgent need. When that stimulant was gone, she would take\\nto whiskey. Man cannot live by work alone. While she was skinning the\\npotatoes, and munching them, a noise behind her made her stop.\\n\\n\"Janey!\" she called, lifting the candle and peering into the darkness.\\n\"Janey, are you there?\"\\n\\nA heap of ragged coats was heaved up, and the face of a young girl\\nemerged, staring sleepily at the woman.\\n\\n\"Deborah,\" she said, at last, \"I\\'m here the night.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, child. Hur\\'s welcome,\" she said, quietly eating on.\\n\\nThe girl\\'s face was haggard and sickly; her eyes were heavy with sleep\\nand hunger: real Milesian eyes they were, dark, delicate blue, glooming\\nout from black shadows with a pitiful fright.\\n\\n\"I was alone,\" she said, timidly.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s the father?\" asked Deborah, holding out a potato, which the\\ngirl greedily seized.\\n\\n\"He\\'s beyant,--wid Haley,--in the stone house.\" (Did you ever hear the\\nword _jail_ from an Irish mouth?) \"I came here. Hugh told me never to\\nstay me-lone.\"\\n\\n\"Hugh?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\nA vexed frown crossed her face. The girl saw it, and added quickly,--\\n\\n\"I have not seen Hugh the day, Deb. The old man says his watch lasts\\ntill the mornin\\'.\"\\n\\nThe woman sprang up, and hastily began to arrange some bread and flitch\\nin a tin pail, and to pour her own measure of ale into a bottle. Tying\\non her bonnet, she blew out the candle.\\n\\n\"Lay ye down, Janey dear,\" she said, gently, covering her with the old\\nrags. \"Hur can eat the potatoes, if hur \\'s hungry.\"\\n\\n\"Where are ye goin\\', Deb? The rain \\'s sharp.\"\\n\\n\"To the mill, with Hugh\\'s supper.\"\\n\\n\"Let him hide till th\\' morn. Sit ye down.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\"--sharply pushing her off. \"The boy\\'ll starve.\"\\n\\nShe hurried from the cellar, while the child wearily coiled herself up\\nfor sleep. The rain was falling heavily, as the woman, pail in hand,\\nemerged from the mouth of the alley, and turned down the narrow street,\\nthat stretched out, long and black, miles before her. Here and there a\\nflicker of gas lighted an uncertain space of muddy footwalk and gutter;\\nthe long rows of houses, except an occasional lager-bier shop, were\\nclosed; now and then she met a band of mill-hands skulking to or from\\ntheir work.\\n\\nNot many even of the inhabitants of a manufacturing town know the vast\\nmachinery of system by which the bodies of workmen are governed, that\\ngoes on unceasingly from year to year. The hands of each mill are\\ndivided into watches that relieve each other as regularly as the\\nsentinels of an army. By night and day the work goes on, the unsleeping\\nengines groan and shriek, the fiery pools of metal boil and surge. Only\\nfor a day in the week, in half-courtesy to public censure, the fires are\\npartially veiled; but as soon as the clock strikes midnight, the great\\nfurnaces break forth with renewed fury, the clamor begins with fresh,\\nbreathless vigor, the engines sob and shriek like \"gods in pain.\"\\n\\nAs Deborah hurried down through the heavy rain, the noise of these\\nthousand engines sounded through the sleep and shadow of the city like\\nfar-off thunder. The mill to which she was going lay on the river, a\\nmile below the city-limits. It was far, and she was weak, aching from\\nstanding twelve hours at the spools. Yet it was her almost nightly walk\\nto take this man his supper, though at every square she sat down to\\nrest, and she knew she should receive small word of thanks.\\n\\nPerhaps, if she had possessed an artist\\'s eye, the picturesque oddity\\nof the scene might have made her step stagger less, and the path seem\\nshorter; but to her the mills were only \"summat deilish to look at by\\nnight.\"\\n\\nThe road leading to the mills had been quarried from the solid rock,\\nwhich rose abrupt and bare on one side of the cinder-covered road, while\\nthe river, sluggish and black, crept past on the other. The mills for\\nrolling iron are simply immense tent-like roofs, covering acres of\\nground, open on every side. Beneath these roofs Deborah looked in on a\\ncity of fires, that burned hot and fiercely in the night. Fire in every\\nhorrible form: pits of flame waving in the wind; liquid metal-flames\\nwrithing in tortuous streams through the sand; wide caldrons filled with\\nboiling fire, over which bent ghastly wretches stirring the strange\\nbrewing; and through all, crowds of half-clad men, looking like\\nrevengeful ghosts in the red light, hurried, throwing masses of\\nglittering fire. It was like a street in Hell. Even Deborah muttered, as\\nshe crept through, \"\\'T looks like t\\' Devil\\'s place!\" It did,--in more\\nways than one.\\n\\nShe found the man she was looking for, at last, heaping coal on a\\nfurnace. He had not time to eat his supper; so she went behind the\\nfurnace, and waited. Only a few men were with him, and they noticed her\\nonly by a \"Hyur comes t\\' hunchback, Wolfe.\"\\n\\nDeborah was stupid with sleep; her back pained her sharply; and her\\nteeth chattered with cold, with the rain that soaked her clothes and\\ndripped from her at every step. She stood, however, patiently holding\\nthe pail, and waiting.\\n\\n\"Hout, woman! ye look like a drowned cat. Come near to the fire,\"--said\\none of the men, approaching to scrape away the ashes.\\n\\nShe shook her head. Wolfe had forgotten her. He turned, hearing the man,\\nand came closer.\\n\\n\"I did no\\' think; gi\\' me my supper, woman.\"\\n\\nShe watched him eat with a painful eagerness. With a woman\\'s quick\\ninstinct, she saw that he was not hungry,--was eating to please her.\\nHer pale, watery eyes began to gather a strange light.\\n\\n\"Is\\'t good, Hugh? T\\'ale was a bit sour, I feared.\"\\n\\n\"No, good enough.\" He hesitated a moment. \"Ye\\'re tired, poor lass! Bide\\nhere till I go. Lay down there on that heap of ash, and go to sleep.\"\\n\\nHe threw her an old coat for a pillow, and turned to his work. The\\nheap was the refuse of the burnt iron, and was not a hard bed; the\\nhalf-smothered warmth, too, penetrated her limbs, dulling their pain and\\ncold shiver.\\n\\nMiserable enough she looked, lying there on the ashes like a limp,\\ndirty rag,--yet not an unfitting figure to crown the scene of hopeless\\ndiscomfort and veiled crime: more fitting, if one looked deeper into the\\nheart of things,--at her thwarted woman\\'s form, her colorless life, her\\nwaking stupor that smothered pain and hunger,--even more fit to be a\\ntype of her class. Deeper yet if one could look, was there nothing worth\\nreading in this wet, faded thing, half-covered with ashes? no story of a\\nsoul filled with groping passionate love, heroic unselfishness, fierce\\njealousy? of years of weary trying to please the one human being whom\\nshe loved, to gain one look of real heart-kindness from him? If anything\\nlike this were hidden beneath the pale, bleared eyes, and dull,\\nwashed-out-looking face, no one had ever taken the trouble to read its\\nfaint signs: not the half-clothed furnace-tender, Wolfe, certainly. Yet\\nhe was kind to her: it was his nature to be kind, even to the very rats\\nthat swarmed in the cellar: kind to her in just the same way. She knew\\nthat. And it might be that very knowledge had given to her face its\\napathy and vacancy more than her low, torpid life. One sees that\\ndead, vacant look steal sometimes over the rarest, finest of women\\'s\\nfaces,--in the very midst, it may be, of their warmest summer\\'s day; and\\nthen one can guess at the secret of intolerable solitude that lies hid\\nbeneath the delicate laces and brilliant smile. There was no warmth, no\\nbrilliancy, no summer for this woman; so the stupor and vacancy had time\\nto gnaw into her face perpetually. She was young, too, though no one\\nguessed it; so the gnawing was the fiercer.\\n\\nShe lay quiet in the dark corner, listening, through the monotonous din\\nand uncertain glare of the works, to the dull plash of the rain in the\\nfar distance,--shrinking back whenever the man Wolfe happened to look\\ntowards her. She knew, in spite of all his kindness, that there was that\\nin her face and form which made him loathe the sight of her. She felt by\\ninstinct, although she could not comprehend it, the finer nature of\\nthe man, which made him among his fellow-workmen something unique, set\\napart. She knew, that, down under all the vileness and coarseness of\\nhis life, there was a groping passion for whatever was beautiful and\\npure,--that his soul sickened with disgust at her deformity, even when\\nhis words were kindest. Through this dull consciousness, which never\\nleft her, came, like a sting, the recollection of the dark blue eyes and\\nlithe figure of the little Irish girl she had left in the cellar. The\\nrecollection struck through even her stupid intellect with a vivid glow\\nof beauty and of grace. Little Janey, timid, helpless, clinging to Hugh\\nas her only friend: that was the sharp thought, the bitter thought, that\\ndrove into the glazed eyes a fierce light of pain. You laugh at it? Are\\npain and jealousy less savage realities down here in this place I am\\ntaking you to than in your own house or your own heart,--your heart,\\nwhich they clutch at sometimes? The note is the same, I fancy, be the\\noctave high or low.\\n\\nIf you could go into this mill where Deborah lay, and drag out from the\\nhearts of these men the terrible tragedy of their lives, taking it as a\\nsymptom of the disease of their class, no ghost Horror would terrify\\nyou more. A reality of soul-starvation, of living death, that meets you\\nevery day under the besotted faces on the street,--I can paint nothing\\nof this, only give you the outside outlines of a night, a crisis in the\\nlife of one man: whatever muddy depth of soul-history lies beneath you\\ncan read according to the eyes God has given you.\\n\\nWolfe, while Deborah watched him as a spaniel its master, bent over the\\nfurnace with his iron pole, unconscious of her scrutiny, only stopping\\nto receive orders. Physically, Nature had promised the man but little.\\nHe had already lost the strength and instinct vigor of a man, his\\nmuscles were thin, his nerves weak, his face (a meek, woman\\'s face)\\nhaggard, yellow with consumption. In the mill he was known as one of the\\ngirl-men: \"Molly Wolfe\" was his _sobriquet_. He was never seen, in\\nthe cockpit, did not own a terrier, drank but seldom; when he did,\\ndesperately. He fought sometimes, but was always thrashed, pommelled to\\na jelly. The man was game enough, when his blood was up: but he was no\\nfavorite in the mill; he had the taint of school-learning on him,--not\\nto a dangerous extent, only a quarter or so in the free-school in fact,\\nbut enough to ruin him as a good hand in a fight.\\n\\nFor other reasons, too, he was not popular. Not one of themselves, they\\nfelt that, though outwardly as filthy and ash-covered; silent, with\\nforeign thoughts and longings breaking out through his quietness in\\ninnumerable curious ways: this one, for instance. In the neighboring\\nfurnace-buildings lay great heaps of the refuse from the ore after the\\npig-metal is run. _Korl_ we call it here: a light, porous substance, of\\na delicate, waxen, flesh- tinge. Out of the blocks of this korl,\\nWolfe, in his off-hours from the furnace, had a habit of chipping and\\nmoulding figures,--hideous, fantastic enough, but sometimes strangely\\nbeautiful: even the mill-men saw that, while they jeered at him. It was\\na curious fancy in the man, almost a passion. The few hours for rest he\\nspent hewing and hacking with his blunt knife, never speaking, until his\\nwatch came again,--working at one figure for months, and, when it was\\nfinished, breaking it to pieces perhaps, in a fit of disappointment. A\\nmorbid, gloomy man, untaught, unled, left to feed his soul in grossness\\nand crime, and hard, grinding labor.\\n\\nI want you to come down and look at this Wolfe, standing there among the\\nlowest of his kind, and see him just as he is, that you may judge him\\njustly when you hear the story of this night. I want you to look back,\\nas he does every day, at his birth in vice, his starved infancy; to\\nremember the heavy years he has groped through as boy and man,--the\\nslow, heavy years of constant, hot work. So long ago he began, that he\\nthinks sometimes he has worked there for ages. There is no hope that it\\nwill ever end. Think that God put into this man\\'s soul a fierce thirst\\nfor beauty,--to know it, to create it; to _be_--something, he knows not\\nwhat,--other than he is. There are moments when a passing cloud, the sun\\nglinting on the purple thistles, a kindly smile, a child\\'s face, will\\nrouse him to a passion of pain,--when his nature starts up with a mad\\ncry of rage against God, man, whoever it is that has forced this vile,\\nslimy life upon him. With all this groping, this mad desire, a great\\nblind intellect stumbling through wrong, a loving poet\\'s heart, the man\\nwas by habit only a coarse, vulgar laborer, familiar with sights and\\nwords you would blush to name. Be just; when I tell you about this\\nnight, see him as he is. Be just,--not like man\\'s law, which seizes on\\none isolated fact, but like God\\'s judging angel, whose clear, sad\\neye saw all the countless cankering days of this man\\'s life, all the\\ncountless nights, when, sick with starving, his soul fainted in him,\\nbefore it judged him for this night, the saddest of all.\\n\\nI called this night the crisis of his life. If it was, it stole on him\\nunawares. These great turning-days of life cast no shadow before, slip\\nby unconsciously. Only a trifle, a little turn of the rudder, and the\\nship goes to heaven or hell.\\n\\nWolfe, while Deborah watched him, dug into the furnace of melting iron\\nwith his pole, dully thinking only how many rails the lump would yield.\\nIt was late,--nearly Sunday morning; another hour, and the heavy work\\nwould be done,--only the furnaces to replenish and cover for the next\\nday. The workmen were growing more noisy, shouting, as they had to do,\\nto be heard over the deep clamor of the mills. Suddenly they grew less\\nboisterous,--at the far end, entirely silent. Something unusual had\\nhappened. After a moment, the silence came nearer; the men stopped their\\njeers and drunken choruses. Deborah, stupidly lifting up her head,\\nsaw the cause of the quiet. A group of five or six men were slowly\\napproaching, stopping to examine each furnace as they came. Visitors\\noften came to see the mills after night: except by growing less noisy,\\nthe men took no notice of them. The furnace where Wolfe worked was near\\nthe bounds of the works; they halted there hot and tired: a walk over\\none of these great foundries is no trifling task. The woman, drawing out\\nof sight, turned over to sleep. Wolfe, seeing them stop, suddenly roused\\nfrom his indifferent stupor, and watched them keenly. He knew some\\nof them: the overseer, Clarke,--a son of Kirby, one of the\\nmill-owners,--and a Doctor May, one of the town-physicians. The other\\ntwo were strangers. Wolfe came closer. He seized eagerly every chance\\nthat brought him into contact with this mysterious class that shone down\\non him perpetually with the glamour of another order of being. What made\\nthe difference between them? That was the mystery of his life. He had\\na vague notion that perhaps to-night he could find it out. One of the\\nstrangers sat down on a pile of bricks, and beckoned young Kirby to his\\nside.\\n\\n\"This _is_ hot, with a vengeance. A match, please?\"--lighting his cigar.\\n\"But the walk is worth the trouble. If it were not that you must have\\nheard it so often, Kirby, I would tell you that your works look like\\nDante\\'s Inferno.\"\\n\\nKirby laughed.\\n\\n\"Yes. Yonder is Farinata himself in the burning tomb,\"--pointing to some\\nfigure in the shimmering shadows.\\n\\n\"Judging from some of the faces of your men,\" said the other, \"they bid\\nfair to try the reality of Dante\\'s vision, some day.\"\\n\\nYoung Kirby looked curiously around, as if seeing the faces of his hands\\nfor the first time.\\n\\n\"They\\'re bad enough, that\\'s true. A desperate set, I fancy. Eh, Clarke?\"\\n\\nThe overseer did not hear him. He was talking of net profits just\\nthen,--giving, in fact, a schedule of the annual business of the firm to\\na sharp peering little Yankee, who jotted down notes on a paper laid on\\nthe crown of his hat: a reporter for one of the city-papers, getting up\\na series of reviews of the leading manufactories. The other gentlemen\\nhad accompanied them merely for amusement. They were silent until the\\nnotes were finished, drying their feet at the furnaces, and sheltering\\ntheir faces from the intolerable heat. At last the overseer concluded\\nwith--\"I believe that is a pretty fair estimate, Captain.\"\\n\\n\"Here, some of you men!\" said Kirby, \"bring up those boards. We may as\\nwell sit down, gentlemen, until the rain is over. It cannot last much\\nlonger at this rate.\"\\n\\n\"Pig-metal,\"--mumbled the reporter,--\"um!--coal facilities,--um!--hands\\nemployed, twelve hundred,--bitumen,--um!--\\'all right, I believe, Mr.\\nClarke;--sinking-fund,--what did you say was your sinking-fund?\"\\n\\n\"Twelve hundred hands?\" said the stranger, the young man who had first\\nspoken. \"Do you control their votes, Kirby?\"\\n\\n\"Control? No.\" The young man smiled complacently. \"But my father brought\\nseven hundred votes to the polls for his candidate last November. No\\nforce-work, you understand,--only a speech or two, a hint to form\\nthemselves into a society, and a bit of red and blue bunting to make\\nthem a flag. The Invincible Roughs,--I believe that is their name. I\\nforget the motto: \\'Our country\\'s hope,\\' I think.\"\\n\\nThere was a laugh. The young man talking to Kirby sat with an amused\\nlight in his cool gray eye, surveying critically the half-clothed\\nfigures of the puddlers, and the slow swing of their brawny muscles. He\\nwas a stranger in the city,--spending a couple of months in the\\nborders of a Slave State, to study the institutions of the South,--a\\nbrother-in-law of Kirby\\'s,--Mitchell. He was an amateur gymnast,--hence\\nhis anatomical eye; a patron, in a _blase_ way, of the prize-ring; a man\\nwho sucked the essence out of a science or philosophy in an indifferent,\\ngentlemanly way; who took Kant, Novalis, Humboldt, for what they were\\nworth in his own scales; accepting all, despising nothing, in heaven,\\nearth, or hell, but one-idead men; with a temper yielding and brilliant\\nas summer water, until his Self was touched, when it was ice, though\\nbrilliant still. Such men are not rare in the States.\\n\\nAs he knocked the ashes from his cigar, Wolfe caught with a quick\\npleasure the contour of the white hand, the blood-glow of a red ring he\\nwore. His voice, too, and that of Kirby\\'s, touched him like music,--low,\\neven, with chording cadences. About this man Mitchell hung the\\nimpalpable atmosphere belonging to the thorough-bred gentleman. Wolfe,\\nscraping away the ashes beside him, was conscious of it, did obeisance\\nto it with his artist sense, unconscious that he did so.\\n\\nThe rain did not cease. Clarke and the reporter left the mills; the\\nothers, comfortably seated near the furnace, lingered, smoking\\nand talking in a desultory way. Greek would not have been more\\nunintelligible to the furnace-tenders, whose presence they soon forgot\\nentirely. Kirby drew out a newspaper from his pocket and read aloud some\\narticle, which they discussed eagerly. At every sentence, Wolfe listened\\nmore and more like a dumb, hopeless animal, with a duller, more stolid\\nlook creeping over his face, glancing now and then at Mitchell, marking\\nacutely every smallest sign of refinement, then back to himself, seeing\\nas in a mirror his filthy body, his more stained soul.\\n\\nNever! He had no words for such a thought, but he knew now, in all the\\nsharpness of the bitter certainty, that between them there was a great\\ngulf never to be passed. Never!\\n\\nThe bell of the mills rang for midnight. Sunday morning had dawned.\\nWhatever hidden message lay in the tolling bells floated past these men\\nunknown. Yet it was there. Veiled in the solemn music ushering the risen\\nSaviour was a key-note to solve the darkest secrets of a world gone\\nwrong,--even this social riddle which the brain of the grimy puddler\\ngrappled with madly to-night.\\n\\nThe men began to withdraw the metal from the caldrons. The mills were\\ndeserted on Sundays, except by the hands who fed the fires, and those\\nwho had no lodgings and slept usually on the ash-heaps. The three\\nstrangers sat still during the next hour, watching the men cover the\\nfurnaces, laughing now and then at some jest of Kirby\\'s.\\n\\n\"Do you know,\" said Mitchell, \"I like this view of the works better than\\nwhen the glare was fiercest? These heavy shadows and the amphitheatre\\nof smothered fires are ghostly, unreal. One could fancy these red\\nsmouldering lights to be the half-shut eyes of wild beasts, and the\\nspectral figures their victims in the den.\"\\n\\nKirby laughed. \"You are fanciful. Come, let us get out of the den. The\\nspectral figures, as you call them, are a little too real for me to\\nfancy a close proximity in the darkness,--unarmed, too.\"\\n\\nThe others rose, buttoning their overcoats, and lighting cigars.\\n\\n\"Raining, still,\" said Doctor May, \"and hard. Where did we leave the\\ncoach, Mitchell?\"\\n\\n\"At the other side of the works.--Kirby, what\\'s that?\"\\n\\nMitchell started back, half-frightened, as, suddenly turning a corner,\\nthe white figure of a woman faced him in the darkness,--a woman, white,\\nof giant proportions, crouching on the ground, her arms flung out in\\nsome wild gesture of warning.\\n\\n\"Stop! Make that fire burn there!\" cried Kirby, stopping short.\\n\\nThe flame burst out, flashing the gaunt figure into bold relief.\\n\\nMitchell drew a long breath.\\n\\n\"I thought it was alive,\" he said, going up curiously.\\n\\nThe others followed.\\n\\n\"Not marble, eh?\" asked Kirby, touching it.\\n\\nOne of the lower overseers stopped.\\n\\n\"Korl, Sir.\"\\n\\n\"Who did it?\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t say. Some of the hands; chipped it out in off-hours.\"\\n\\n\"Chipped to some purpose, I should say. What a flesh-tint the stuff has!\\nDo you see, Mitchell?\"\\n\\n\"I see.\"\\n\\nHe had stepped aside where the light fell boldest on the figure, looking\\nat it in silence. There was not one line of beauty or grace in it: a\\nnude woman\\'s form, muscular, grown coarse with labor, the powerful limbs\\ninstinct with some one poignant longing. One idea: there it was in the\\ntense, rigid muscles, the clutching hands, the wild, eager face, like\\nthat of a starving wolf\\'s. Kirby and Doctor May walked around it,\\ncritical, curious. Mitchell stood aloof, silent. The figure touched him\\nstrangely.\\n\\n\"Not badly done,\" said Doctor May. \"Where did the fellow learn that\\nsweep of the muscles in the arm and hand? Look at them! They are\\ngroping,--do you see?--clutching: the peculiar action of a man dying of\\nthirst.\"\\n\\n\"They have ample facilities for studying anatomy,\" sneered Kirby,\\nglancing at the half-naked figures.\\n\\n\"Look,\" continued the Doctor, \"at this bony wrist, and the strained\\nsinews of the instep! A working-woman,--the very type of her class.\"\\n\\n\"God forbid!\" muttered Mitchell.\\n\\n\"Why?\" demanded May. \"What does the fellow intend by the figure? I\\ncannot catch the meaning.\"\\n\\n\"Ask him,\" said the other, dryly. \"There he stands,\"--pointing to Wolfe,\\nwho stood with a group of men, leaning on his ash-rake.\\n\\nThe Doctor beckoned him with the affable smile which kind-hearted men\\nput on, when talking to these people.\\n\\n\"Mr. Mitchell has picked you out as the man who did this,--I\\'m sure I\\ndon\\'t know why. But what did you mean by it?\"\\n\\n\"She be hungry.\"\\n\\nWolfe\\'s eyes answered Mitchell, not the Doctor.\\n\\n\"Oh-h! But what a mistake you have made, my fine fellow! You have given\\nno sign of starvation to the body. It is strong,--terribly strong. It\\nhas the mad, half-despairing gesture of drowning.\"\\n\\nWolfe stammered, glanced appealingly at Mitchell, who saw the soul of\\nthe thing, he knew. But the cool, probing eyes were turned on himself\\nnow,--mocking, cruel, relentless.\\n\\n\"Not hungry for meat,\" the furnace-tender said at last.\\n\\n\"What then? Whiskey?\" jeered Kirby, with a coarse laugh.\\n\\nWolfe was silent a moment, thinking.\\n\\n\"I dunno,\" he said, with a bewildered look. \"It mebbe. Summat to make\\nher live, I think,--like you. Whiskey ull do it, in a way.\"\\n\\nThe young man laughed again. Mitchell flashed a look of disgust\\nsomewhere,--not at Wolfe.\\n\\n\"May,\" he broke out impatiently, \"are you blind? Look at that woman\\'s\\nface! It asks questions of God, and says, \\'I have a right to know.\\' Good\\nGod, how hungry it is!\"\\n\\nThey looked a moment; then May turned to the mill-owner:--\\n\\n\"Have you many such hands as this? What are you going to do with them?\\nKeep them at puddling iron?\"\\n\\nKirby shrugged his shoulders. Mitchell\\'s look had irritated him.\\n\\n\"_Ce n\\'est pas mon affaire_. I have no fancy for nursing infant\\ngeniuses. I suppose there are some stray gleams of mind and soul among\\nthese wretches. The Lord will take care of his own; or else they can\\nwork out their own salvation. I have heard you call our American system\\na ladder which any man can scale. Do you doubt it? Or perhaps you want\\nto banish all social ladders, and put us all on a flat table-land,--eh,\\nMay?\"\\n\\nThe Doctor looked vexed, puzzled. Some terrible problem lay hid in this\\nwoman\\'s face, and troubled these men. Kirby waited for an answer, and,\\nreceiving none, went on, warning with his subject.\\n\\n\"I tell you, there\\'s something wrong that no talk of \\'_Liberte_\\' or\\n\\'_Egalite_\\' will do away. If I had the making of men, these men who\\ndo the lowest part of the world\\'s work should be machines,--nothing\\nmore,--hands. It would be kindness. God help them! What are taste,\\nreason, to creatures who must live such lives as that?\" He pointed to\\nDeborah, sleeping on the ash-heap. \"So many nerves to sting them to\\npain. What if God had put your brain, with all its agony of touch, into\\nyour fingers, and bid you work and strike with that?\"\\n\\n\"You think you could govern the world better?\" laughed the Doctor.\\n\\n\"I do not think at all.\"\\n\\n\"That is true philosophy. Drift with the stream, because you cannot dive\\ndeep enough to find bottom, eh?\"\\n\\n\"Exactly,\" rejoined Kirby. \"I do not think. I wash my hands of all\\nsocial problems,--slavery, caste, white or black. My duty to my\\noperatives has a narrow limit,--the pay-hour on Saturday night. Outside\\nof that, if they cut korl, or cut each other\\'s throats, (the more\\npopular amusement of the two,) I am not responsible.\"\\n\\nThe Doctor sighed,--a good honest sigh, from the depths of his stomach.\\n\\n\"God help us! Who is responsible?\"\\n\\n\"Not I, I tell you,\" said Kirby, testily. \"What has the man who pays\\nthem money to do with their souls\\' concerns, more than the grocer or\\nbutcher who takes it?\"\\n\\n\"And yet,\" said Mitchell\\'s cynical voice, \"look at her! How hungry she\\nis!\"\\n\\nKirby tapped his boot with his cane. No one spoke. Only the dumb face of\\nthe rough image looking into their faces with the awful question, \"What\\nshall we do to be saved?\" Only Wolfe\\'s face, with its heavy weight of\\nbrain, its weak, uncertain mouth, its desperate eyes, out of which\\nlooked the soul of his class,--only Wolfe\\'s face turned towards Kirby\\'s.\\nMitchell laughed,--a cool, musical laugh.\\n\\n\"Money has spoken!\" he said, seating himself lightly on a stone with the\\nair of an amused spectator at a play. \"Are you answered?\"--turning to\\nWolfe his clear, magnetic face.\\n\\nBright and deep and cold as Arctic air, the soul of the man lay tranquil\\nbeneath. He looked at the furnace-tender as he had looked at a rare\\nmosaic in the morning; only the man was the more amusing study of the\\ntwo.\\n\\n\"Are you answered? Why, May, look at him! \\'_De profundis clamavi_.\\' Or,\\nto quote in English, \\'Hungry and thirsty, his soul faints in him.\\' And\\nso Money sends back its answer into the depths through you, Kirby!\\nVery clear the answer, too!--I think I remember reading the same words\\nsomewhere:--washing your hands in Eau de Cologne, and saying, \\'I am\\ninnocent of the blood of this man. See ye to it!\\'\"\\n\\nKirby flushed angrily.\\n\\n\"You quote Scripture freely.\"\\n\\n\"Do I not quote correctly? I think I remember another line, which may\\namend my meaning: \\'Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these,\\nye did it unto me.\\' Deist? Bless you, man, I was raised on the milk of\\nthe Word. Now, Doctor, the pocket of the world having uttered its\\nvoice, what has the heart to say? You are a philanthropist, in a small\\nway,--_n\\'est ce pas_? Here, boy, this gentleman can show you how to cut\\nkorl better,--or your destiny. Go on, May!\"\\n\\n\"I think a mocking devil possesses you to-night,\" rejoined the Doctor,\\nseriously.\\n\\nHe went to Wolfe and put his hand kindly on his arm. Something of a\\nvague idea possessed the Doctor\\'s brain that much good was to be done\\nhere by a friendly word or two: a latent genius to be warmed into life\\nby a waited-for sunbeam. Here it was: he had brought it. So he went on\\ncomplacently:--\\n\\n\"Do you know, boy, you have it in you to be a great sculptor, a great\\nman?--do you understand?\" (talking down to the capacity of his hearer:\\nit is a way people have with children, and men like Wolfe,)--\"to live a\\nbetter, stronger life than I, or Mr. Kirby here? A man may make himself\\nanything he chooses. God has given you stronger powers than many\\nmen,--me, for instance.\"\\n\\nMay stopped, heated, glowing with his own magnanimity. And it was\\nmagnanimous. The puddler had drunk in every word, looking through the\\nDoctor\\'s flurry, and generous heat, and self-approval, into his will,\\nwith those slow, absorbing eyes of his.\\n\\n\"Make yourself what you will. It is your right.\"\\n\\n\"I know,\" quietly. \"Will you help me?\"\\n\\nMitchell laughed again. The Doctor turned now, in a passion,--\\n\\n\"You know, Mitchell, I have not the means. You know, if I had, it is in\\nmy heart to take this boy and educate him for\"----\\n\\n\"The glory of God, and the glory of John May.\"\\n\\nMay did not speak for a moment; then, controlled, he said,--\\n\\n\"Why should one be raised, when myriads are left?--I have not the money,\\nboy,\" to Wolfe, shortly.\\n\\n\"Money?\" He said it over slowly, as one repeals the guessed answer to a\\nriddle, doubtfully. \"That is it? Money?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, money,--that is it,\" said Mitchell, rising, and drawing his\\nfurred coat about him. \"You\\'ve found the cure for all the world\\'s\\ndiseases.--Come, May, find your good-humor, and come home. This damp\\nwind chills my very bones. Come and preach your Saint-Simonian doctrines\\nto-morrow to Kirby\\'s hands. Let them have a clear idea of the rights of\\nthe soul, and I\\'ll venture next week they\\'ll strike for higher wages.\\nThat will be the end of it.\"\\n\\n\"Will you send the coach-driver to this side of the mills?\" asked Kirby,\\nturning to Wolfe.\\n\\nHe spoke kindly: it was his habit to do so. Deborah, seeing the puddler\\ngo, crept after him. The three men waited outside. Doctor May walked up\\nand down, chafed. Suddenly he stopped.\\n\\n\"Go back, Mitchell! You say the pocket and the heart of the world speak\\nwithout meaning to these people. What has its head to say? Taste,\\nculture, refinement? Go!\"\\n\\nMitchell was leaning against a brick wall. He turned his head\\nindolently, and looked into the mills. There hung about the place a\\nthick, unclean odor. The slightest motion of his hand marked that he\\nperceived it, and his insufferable disgust. That was all. May said\\nnothing, only quickened his angry tramp.\\n\\n\"Besides,\" added Mitchell, giving a corollary to his answer, \"it would\\nbe of no use. I am not one of them.\"\\n\\n\"You do not mean\"--said May, facing him.\\n\\n\"Yes, I mean just that. Reform is born of need, not pity. No vital\\nmovement of the people\\'s has worked down, for good or evil; fermented,\\ninstead, carried up the heaving, cloggy mass. Think back through\\nhistory, and you will know it. What will this lowest deep--thieves,\\nMagdalens, <DW64>s--do with the light filtered through ponderous Church\\ncreeds, Baconian theories, Goethe schemes? Some day, out of their bitter\\nneed will be thrown up their own light-bringer,--their Jean Paul, their\\nCromwell, their Messiah.\"\\n\\n\"Bah!\" was the Doctor\\'s inward criticism. However, in practice, he\\nadopted the theory; for, when, night and morning, afterwards, he prayed\\nthat power might be given these degraded souls to rise, he glowed at\\nheart, recognizing an accomplished duty.\\n\\nWolfe and the woman had stood in the shadow of the works as the coach\\ndrove off. The Doctor had held out his hand in a frank, generous way,\\ntelling him to \"take care of himself, and to remember it was his right\\nto rise.\" Mitchell had simply touched his hat, as to an equal, with a\\nquiet look of thorough recognition. Kirby had thrown Deborah some money,\\nwhich she found, and clutched eagerly enough. They were gone now, all\\nof them. The man sat down on the cinder-road, looking up into the murky\\nsky.\\n\\n\"\\'T be late, Hugh. Wunnot hur come?\"\\n\\nHe shook his head doggedly, and the woman crouched out of his sight\\nagainst the wall. Do you remember rare moments when a sudden\\nlight flashed over yourself, your world, God? when you stood on a\\nmountain-peak, seeing your life as it might have been, as it is? one\\nquick instant, when custom lost its force and every-day usage? when your\\nfriend, wife, brother, stood in a new light? your soul was bared, and\\nthe grave,--a foretaste of the nakedness of the Judgment-Day? So it came\\nbefore him, his life, that night. The slow tides of pain he had borne\\ngathered themselves up and surged against his soul. His squalid daily\\nlife, the brutal coarseness eating into his brain, as the ashes into\\nhis skin: before, these things had been a dull aching into his\\nconsciousness; to-night, they were reality. He griped the filthy red\\nshirt that clung, stiff with soot, about him, and tore it savagely from\\nhis arm. The flesh beneath was muddy with grease and ashes,--and the\\nheart beneath that! And the soul? God knows.\\n\\nThen flashed before his vivid poetic sense the man who had left\\nhim,--the pure face, the delicate, sinewy limbs, in harmony with all he\\nknew of beauty or truth. In his cloudy fancy he had pictured a Something\\nlike this. He had found it in this Mitchell, even when he idly scoffed\\nat his pain: a Man all-knowing, all-seeing, crowned by Nature,\\nreigning,--the keen glance of his eye falling like a sceptre on other\\nmen. And yet his instinct taught him that he too--He! He looked at\\nhimself with sudden loathing, sick, wrung his hands with a cry, and then\\nwas silent. With all the phantoms of his heated, ignorant fancy, Wolfe\\nhad not been vague in his ambitious. They were practical, slowly built\\nup before him out of his knowledge of what he could do. Through years\\nhe had day by day made this hope a real thing to himself,--a clear,\\nprojected figure of himself, as he might become.\\n\\nAble to speak, to know what was best, to raise these men and women\\nworking at his side up with him: sometimes he forgot this defined hope\\nin the frantic anguish to escape,--only to escape,--out of the wet, the\\npain, the ashes, somewhere, anywhere,--only for one moment of free air\\non a hill-side, to lie down and let his sick soul throb itself out in\\nthe sunshine. But to-night he panted for life. The savage strength of\\nhis nature was roused; his cry was fierce to God for justice.\\n\\n\"Look at me!\" he said to Deborah, with a low, bitter laugh, striking his\\npuny chest savagely. \"What am I worth, Deb? Is it my fault that I am no\\nbetter? My fault? My fault?\"\\n\\nHe stopped, stung with a sudden remorse, seeing her hunchback shape\\nwrithing with sobs. For Deborah was crying thankless tears, according to\\nthe fashion of women.\\n\\n\"God forgi\\' me, woman! Things go harder wi\\' you nor me. It\\'s a worse\\nshare.\"\\n\\nHe got up and helped her to rise; and they went doggedly down the muddy\\nstreet, side by side.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all wrong,\" he muttered, slowly,--\"all wrong! I dunnot\\nunderstan\\'. But it\\'ll end some day.\"\\n\\n\"Come home, Hugh!\" she said, coaxingly; for he had stopped, looking\\naround bewildered.\\n\\n\"Home,--and back to the mill!\" He went on saying this over to himself,\\nas if he would mutter down every pain in this dull despair.\\n\\nShe followed him through the fog, her blue lips chattering with cold.\\nThey reached the cellar at last. Old Wolfe had been drinking since she\\nwent out, and had crept nearer the door. The girl Janey slept heavily In\\nthe corner. He went up to her, touching softly the worn white arm with\\nhis fingers. Some bitterer thought stung him, as he stood there. He\\nwiped the drops from his forehead, and went into the room beyond, livid,\\ntrembling. A hope, trifling, perhaps, but very dear, had died just then\\nout of the poor puddler\\'s life, as he looked at the sleeping, innocent\\ngirl,--some plan for the future, in which she had borne a part. He gave\\nit up that moment, then and forever. Only a trifle, perhaps, to us: his\\nface grew a shade paler,--that was all. But, somehow, the man\\'s soul, as\\nGod and the angels looked down on it, never was the same afterwards.\\n\\nDeborah followed him into the inner room. She carried a candle, which\\nshe placed on the floor, dosing the door after her. She had seen the\\nlook on his face, as he turned away: her own grew deadly. Yet, as she\\ncame up to him, her eyes glowed. He was seated on an old chest, quiet,\\nholding his face in his hands.\\n\\n\"Hugh!\" she said, softly.\\n\\nHe did not speak.\\n\\n\"Hugh, did hur hear what the man said,--him with the clear voice? Did\\nhur hear? Money, money,--that it wud do all?\"\\n\\nHe pushed her away,--gently, but he was worn out; her rasping tone\\nfretted him.\\n\\n\"Hugh!\"\\n\\nThe candle flared a pale yellow light over the cobwebbed brick walls,\\nand the woman standing there. He looked at her. She was young, in deadly\\nearnest; her faded eyes, and wet, ragged figure caught from their\\nfrantic eagerness a power akin to beauty.\\n\\n\"Hugh, it is true! Money ull do it! Oh, Hugh, boy, listen till me! He\\nsaid it true! It is money!\"\\n\\n\"I know. Go back! I do not want you here.\"\\n\\n\"Hugh, it is t\\' last time. I \\'II never worrit hur again.\"\\n\\nThere were tears in her voice now, but she choked them back.\\n\\n\"Hear till me only to-night! If one of t\\' witch people wud come, them we\\nheard of t\\' home, and gif hur all hur wants, what then? Say, Hugh!\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"I mean money.\".\\n\\nHer whisper shrilled through his brain.\\n\\n\"If one of t\\' witch dwarfs wud come from t\\' lane moors to-night, and gif\\nhur money, to go out,--_out_, I say,--out, lad, where t\\' sun shines, and\\nt\\' heath grows, and t\\' ladies walk in silken gownds, and God stays all\\nt\\' time,--where t\\' man lives that talked to us to-night,--Hugh knows,\\n--Hugh could walk there like a king!\"\\n\\nHe thought the woman mad, tried to check her, but she went on, fierce in\\nher eager haste.\\n\\n\"If _I_ were t\\' witch dwarf, if I had f money, wud hur thank me? Wud hur\\ntake me out o\\' this place wid hur and Janey? I wud not come into the\\ngran\\' house hur wud build, to vex hur wid t\\' hunch,--only at night, when\\nt\\' shadows were dark, stand far off to see hur.\"\\n\\nMad? Yes! Are many of us mad in this way?\\n\\n\"Poor Deb! poor Deb!\" he said, soothingly.\\n\\n\"It is here,\" she said, suddenly jerking into his hand a small roll.\\n\"I took it! I did it! Me, me!--not hur! I shall be hanged, I shall be\\nburnt in hell, if anybody knows I took it! Out of his pocket, as he\\nleaned against t\\' bricks. Hur knows?\"\\n\\nShe thrust it into his hand, and then, her errand done, began to gather\\nchips together to make a fire, choking down hysteric sobs.\\n\\n\"Has it come to this?\"\\n\\nThat was all he said. The Welsh Wolfe blood was honest. The roll was a\\nsmall green pocket-book containing one or two gold pieces, and a check\\nfor an incredible amount, as it seemed to the poor puddler. He laid it\\ndown, hiding his face again in his hands.\\n\\n\"Hugh, don\\'t be angry wud me! It\\'s only poor Deb,--hur knows?\"\\n\\nHe took the long skinny fingers kindly in his.\\n\\n\"Angry? God help me, no! Let me sleep. I am tired.\"\\n\\nHe threw himself heavily down on the wooden bench, stunned with pain and\\nweariness. She brought some old rags to cover him.\\n\\nIt was late on Sunday evening before he awoke. I tell God\\'s truth, when\\nI say he had then no thought of keeping this money. Deborah had hid it\\nin his pocket. He found it there. She watched him eagerly, as he took it\\nout.\\n\\n\"I must gif it to him,\" he said, reading her face.\\n\\n\"Hur knows,\" she said with a bitter sigh of disappointment. \"But it is\\nhur right to keep it.\"\\n\\nHis right! The word struck him. Doctor May had used the same. He washed\\nhimself, and went out to find this man Mitchell. His right! Why did this\\nchance word cling to him so obstinately? Do you hear the fierce devils\\nwhisper in his ear, as he went slowly down the darkening street?\\n\\nThe evening came on, slow and calm. He seated himself at the end of\\nan alley leading into one of the larger streets. His brain was clear\\nto-night, keen, intent, mastering. It would not start back, cowardly,\\nfrom any hellish temptation, but meet it face to face. Therefore the\\ngreat temptation of his life came to him veiled by no sophistry, but\\nbold, defiant, owning its own vile name, trusting to one bold blow for\\nvictory.\\n\\nHe did not deceive himself. Theft! That was it. At first the word\\nsickened him; then he grappled with it. Sitting there on a broken\\ncart-wheel, the fading day, the noisy groups, the church-bells\\' tolling\\npassed before him like a panorama, while the sharp struggle went on\\nwithin. This money! He took it out, and looked at it. If he gave it\\nback, what then? He was going to be cool about it.\\n\\nPeople going by to church saw only a sickly mill-boy watching them\\nquietly at the alley\\'s mouth. They did not know that he was mad, or they\\nwould not have gone by so quietly: mad with hunger; stretching out his\\nhands to the world, that had given so much to them, for leave to live\\nthe life God meant him to live. His soul within him was smothering to\\ndeath; he wanted so much, thought so much, and _knew_--nothing. There\\nwas nothing of which he was certain, except the mill and things there.\\nOf God and heaven he had heard so little, that they were to him what\\nfairy-land is to a child: something real, but not here; very far off.\\nHis brain, greedy, dwarfed, full of thwarted energy and unused powers,\\nquestioned these men and women going by, coldly, bitterly, that night.\\nWas it not his right to live as they,--a pure life, a good, true-hearted\\nlife, full of beauty and kind words? He only wanted to know how to use\\nthe strength within him. His heart warmed, as he thought of it. He\\nsuffered himself to think of it longer. If he took the money?\\n\\nThen he saw himself as he might be, strong, helpful, kindly. The night\\ncrept on, as this one image slowly evolved itself from the crowd of\\nother thoughts and stood triumphant. He looked at it. As he might be!\\nWhat wonder, if it blinded him to delirium,--the madness that underlies\\nall revolution, all progress, and all fall?\\n\\nYou laugh at the shallow temptation? You see the error underlying\\nits argument so clearly,--that to him a true life was one of full\\ndevelopment rather than self-restraint? that he was deaf to the higher\\ntone in a cry of voluntary suffering for truth\\'s sake than in the\\nfullest flow of spontaneous harmony? I do not plead his cause. I only\\nwant to show you the mote in my brother\\'s eye: then you can see clearly\\nto take it out.\\n\\nThe money,--there it lay on his knee, a little blotted slip of paper,\\nnothing in itself; used to raise him out of the pit; something straight\\nfrom God\\'s hand. A thief! Well, what was it to be a thief? He met the\\nquestion at last, face to face, wiping the clammy drops of sweat\\nfrom his forehead. God made this money--the fresh air, too--for his\\nchildren\\'s use. He never made the difference between poor and rich. The\\nSomething who looked down on him that moment through the cool gray sky\\nhad a kindly face, he knew,--loved his children alike. Oh, he knew that!\\n\\nThere were times when the soft floods of color in the crimson and purple\\nflames, or the clear depth of amber in the water below the bridge, had\\nsomehow given him a glimpse of another world than this,--of an infinite\\ndepth of beauty and of quiet somewhere,--somewhere,--a depth of quiet\\nand rest and love. Looking up now, it became strangely real. The sun had\\nsunk quite below the hills, but his last rays struck upward, touching\\nthe zenith. The fog had risen, and the town and river were steeped in\\nits thick, gray damp; but overhead, the sun-touched smoke-clouds opened\\nlike a cleft ocean,--shifting, rolling seas of crimson mist, waves of\\nbillowy silver reined with blood-scarlet, inner depths unfathomable of\\nglancing light. Wolfe\\'s artist-eye grew drunk with color. The gates of\\nthat other world! Fading, flashing before him now! What, in that world\\nof Beauty, Content, and Right, were the petty laws, the mine and thine,\\nof mill-owners and mill-hands?\\n\\nA consciousness of power stirred within him. He stood up. A man,--he\\nthought, stretching out his hands,--free to work, to live, to love!\\nFree! His right! He folded the scrap of paper in his hand. As his\\nnervous fingers took it in, limp and blotted, so his soul took in the\\nmean temptation, lapped it in fancied rights, in dreams of improved\\nexistences, drifting and endless as the cloud-seas of color. Clutching\\nit, as if the tightness of his hold would strengthen his sense of\\npossession, he went aimlessly down the street. It was his watch at the\\nmill. He need not go, need never go again, thank God!--shaking off the\\nthought with unspeakable loathing.\\n\\nShall I go over the history of the hours of that night? how the\\nman wandered from one to another of his old haunts, with a\\nhalf-consciousness of bidding them farewell,--lanes and alleys and\\nback-yards where the mill-hands lodged,--noting, with a new eagerness,\\nthe filth and drunkenness, the pig-pens, the ash-heaps covered with\\npotato-skins, the bloated, pimpled women at the doors,--with a new\\ndisgust, a new sense of sudden triumph, and, under all, a new, vague\\ndread, unknown before, smothered down, kept under, but still there? It\\nleft him but once during the night, when, for the second time in his\\nlife, he entered a church. It was a sombre Gothic pile, where the\\nstained light lost itself in far-retreating arches; built to meet the\\nrequirements and sympathies of a far other class than Wolfe\\'s. Yet it\\ntouched, moved him uncontrollably. The distances, the shadows, the\\nstill, marble figures, the mass of silent kneeling worshippers, the\\nmysterious music, thrilled, lifted his soul with a wonderful pain. Wolfe\\nforgot himself, forgot the new life he was going to live, the mean\\nterror gnawing underneath. The voice of the speaker strengthened the\\ncharm; it was clear, feeling, full, strong. An old man, who had lived\\nmuch, suffered much; whose brain was keenly alive, dominant; whose heart\\nwas summer-warm with charity. He taught it to-night. He held up Humanity\\nin its grand total; showed the great world-cancer to his people. Who\\ncould show it better? He was a Christian reformer; he had studied the\\nage thoroughly; his outlook at man had been free, world-wide, over all\\ntime. His faith stood sublime upon the Rock of Ages; his fiery zeal\\nguided vast schemes by which the gospel was to be preached to all\\nnations. How did he preach it to-night? In burning, light-laden words he\\npainted the incarnate Life, Love, the universal Man: words that became\\nreality in the lives of these people,--that lived again in beautiful\\nwords and actions, trifling, but heroic. Sin, as he defied it, was a\\nreal foe to them; their trials, temptations, were his. His words passed\\nfar over the furnace-tender\\'s grasp, toned to suit another class of\\nculture; they sounded in his ears a very pleasant song in an unknown\\ntongue. He meant to cure this world-cancer with a steady eye that\\nhad never glared with hunger, and a hand that neither poverty nor\\nstrychnine-whiskey had taught to shake. In this morbid, distorted heart\\nof the Welsh puddler he had failed.\\n\\nWolfe rose at last, and turned from the church down the street. He\\nlooked up; the night had come on foggy, damp; the golden mists had\\nvanished, and the sky lay dull and ash-. He wandered again\\naimlessly down the street, idly wondering what had become of the\\ncloud-sea of crimson and scarlet. The trial-day of this man\\'s life was\\nover, and he had lost the victory. What followed was mere drifting\\ncircumstance,--a quicker walking over the path,--that was all. Do you\\nwant to hear the end of it? You wish me to make a tragic story out of\\nit? Why, in the police-reports of the morning paper you can find a dozen\\nsuch tragedies: hints of ship-wrecks unlike any that ever befell on the\\nhigh seas; hints that here a power was lost to heaven,--that there a\\nsoul went down where no tide can ebb or flow. Commonplace enough the\\nhints are,--jocose sometimes, done up in rhyme.\\n\\nDoctor May, a month after the night I have told you of, was reading to\\nhis wife at breakfast from this fourth column of the morning-paper: an\\nunusual thing,--these police-reports not being, in general, choice\\nreading for ladies; but it was only one item he read.\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear! You remember that man I told you of, that we saw at\\nKirby\\'s mill?--that was arrested for robbing Mitchell? Here he is; just\\nlisten:--\\'Circuit Court. Judge Day, Hugh Wolfe, operative in Kirby &\\nJohn\\'s Loudon Mills. Charge, grand larceny. Sentence, nineteen years\\nhard labor in penitentiary.\\'--Scoundrel! Serves him right! After all\\nour kindness that night! Picking Mitchell\\'s pocket at the very time!\"\\n\\nHis wife said something about the ingratitude of that kind of people,\\nand then they began to talk of something else.\\n\\nNineteen years! How easy that was to read! What a simple word for Judge\\nDay to utter! Nineteen years! Half a lifetime!\\n\\nHugh Wolfe sat on the window-ledge of his cell, looking out. His ankles\\nwere ironed. Not usual in such cases; but he had made two desperate\\nefforts to escape. \"Well,\" as Haley, the jailer, said, \"small blame\\nto him! Nineteen years\\' imprisonment was not a pleasant thing to look\\nforward to.\" Haley was very good-natured about it, though Wolfe had\\nfought him savagely.\\n\\n\"When he was first caught,\" the jailer said afterwards, in telling the\\nstory, \"before the trial, the fellow was cut down at once,--laid there\\non that pallet like a dead man, with his hands over his eyes. Never saw\\na man so cut down in my life. Time of the trial, too, came the queerest\\ndodge of any customer I ever had. Would choose no lawyer. Judge gave him\\none, of course. Gibson it was. He tried to prove the fellow crazy; but\\nit wouldn\\'t go. Thing was plain as daylight: money found on him. \\'Twas a\\nhard sentence,--all the law allows; but it was for \\'xample\\'s sake. These\\nmill-hands are gettin\\' onbearable. When the sentence was read, he just\\nlooked up, and said the money was his by rights, and that all the world\\nhad gone wrong. That night, after the trial, a gentleman came to see him\\nhere, name of Mitchell,--him as he stole from. Talked to him for an\\nhour. Thought he came for curiosity, like. After he was gone, thought\\nWolfe was remarkable quiet, and went into his cell. Found him very low;\\nbed all bloody. Doctor said he had been bleeding at the lungs. He was as\\nweak as a cat; yet, if ye\\'ll b\\'lieve me, he tried to get a-past me and\\nget out. I just carried him like a baby, and threw him on the pallet.\\nThree days after, he tried it again: that time reached the wall. Lord\\nhelp you! he fought like a tiger,--giv\\' some terrible blows. Fightin\\'\\nfor life, you see; for he can\\'t live long, shut up in the stone crib\\ndown yonder. Got a death-cough now. \\'T took two of us to bring him down\\nthat day; so I just put the irons on his feet. There he sits, in there.\\nGoin\\' to-morrow, with a batch more of \\'em. That woman, hunchback, tried\\nwith him,--you remember?--she\\'s only got three years. \\'Complice. But\\n_she\\'s_ a woman, you know. He\\'s been quiet ever since I put on irons:\\ngiv\\' up, I suppose. Looks white, sick-lookin\\'. It acts different on \\'em,\\nbein\\' sentenced. Most of \\'em gets reckless, devilish-like. Some prays\\nawful, and sings them vile songs of the mills, all in a breath. That\\nwoman, now, she\\'s desper\\'t\\'. Been beggin\\' to see Hugh, as she calls him,\\nfor three days. I\\'m a-goin\\' to let her in. She don\\'t go with him. Here\\nshe is in this next cell. I\\'m a-goin\\' now to let her in.\"\\n\\nHe let her in. Wolfe did not see her. She crept into a corner of the\\ncell, and stood watching him. He was scratching the iron bars of the\\nwindow with a piece of tin which he had picked up, with an idle,\\nuncertain, vacant stare, just as a child or idiot would do.\\n\\n\"Tryin\\' to get out, old boy?\" laughed Haley. \"Them irons will need a\\ncrowbar beside your tin, before you can open \\'em.\"\\n\\nWolfe laughed, too, in a senseless way.\\n\\n\"I think I\\'ll get out,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I believe his brain\\'s touched,\" said Haley, when he came out.\\n\\nThe puddler scraped away with the tin for half an hour. Still Deborah\\ndid not speak. At last she ventured nearer, and touched his arm.\\n\\n\"Blood?\" she said, looking at some spots on his coat with a shudder.\\n\\nHe looked up at her. \"Why, Deb!\" he said, smiling,--such a bright,\\nboyish smile, that it went to poor Deborah\\'s heart directly, and she\\nsobbed and cried out loud.\\n\\n\"Oh, Hugh, lad! Hugh! dunnot look at me, when it wur my fault! To think\\nI brought hur to it! And I loved hur so! Oh, lad, I dud!\"\\n\\nThe confession, even in this wretch, came with the woman\\'s blush through\\nthe sharp cry.\\n\\nHe did not seem to hear her,--scraping away diligently at the bars with\\nthe bit of tin.\\n\\nWas he going mad? She peered closely into his face. Something she saw\\nthere made her draw suddenly back,--something which Haley had not seen,\\nthat lay beneath the pinched, vacant look it had caught since the trial,\\nor the curious gray shadow that rested on it. That gray shadow,--yes,\\nshe knew what that meant. She had often seen it creeping over women\\'s\\nfaces for months, who died at last of slow hunger or consumption. That\\nmeant death, distant, lingering: but this--Whatever it was the woman\\nsaw, or thought she saw, used as she was to crime and misery, seemed to\\nmake her sick with a new horror. Forgetting her fear of him, she caught\\nhis shoulders, and looked keenly, steadily, into his eyes.\\n\\n\"Hugh!\" she cried, in a desperate whisper,--\"oh, boy, not that! for\\nGod\\'s sake, not _that!_\"\\n\\nThe vacant laugh went off his face, and he answered her in a muttered\\nword or two that drove her away. Yet the words were kindly enough.\\nSitting there on his pallet, she cried silently a hopeless sort of\\ntears, but did not speak again. The man looked up furtively at her now\\nand then. Whatever his own trouble was, her distress vexed him with a\\nmomentary sting.\\n\\nIt was market-day. The narrow window of the jail looked down directly on\\nthe carts and wagons drawn up in a long line, where they had unloaded.\\nHe could see, too, and hear distinctly the clink of money as it changed\\nhands, the busy crowd of whites and blacks shoving, pushing one another,\\nand the chaffering and swearing at the stalls. Somehow, the sound, more\\nthan anything else had done, wakened him up,--made the whole real to\\nhim. He was done with the world and the business of it. He let the tin\\nfall, and looked out, pressing his face close to the rusty bars. How\\nthey crowded and pushed! And he,--he should never walk that pavement\\nagain! There came Neff Sanders, one of the feeders at the mill, with\\na basket on his arm. Sure enough, Neff was married the other week. He\\nwhistled, hoping he would look up; but he did not. He wondered if Neff\\nremembered he was there,--if any of the boys thought of him up there,\\nand thought that he never was to go down that old cinder-road again.\\nNever again! He had not quite understood it before; but now he did. Not\\nfor days or years, but never!--that was it.\\n\\nHow clear the light fell on that stall in front of the market! and how\\nlike a picture it was, the dark-green heaps of corn, and the crimson\\nbeets, and golden melons! There was another with game: how the light\\nflickered on that pheasant\\'s breast, with the purplish blood dripping\\nover the brown feathers! He could see the red shining of the drops, it\\nwas so near. In one minute he could be down there. It was just a step.\\nSo easy, as it seemed, so natural to go! Yet it could never be--not in\\nall the thousands of years to come--that he should put his foot on that\\nstreet again! He thought of himself with a sorrowful pity, as of some\\none else. There was a dog down in the market, walking after his master\\nwith such a stately, grave look!--only a dog, yet he could go backwards\\nand forwards just as he pleased: he had good luck! Why, the very vilest\\ncur, yelping there in the gutter, had not lived his life, had been free\\nto act out whatever thought God had put into his brain; while he--No, he\\nwould not think of that! He tried to put the thought away, and to listen\\nto a dispute between a countryman and a woman about some meat; but it\\nwould come back. He, what had he done to bear this?\\n\\nThen came the sudden picture of what might have been, and now. He knew\\nwhat it was to be in the penitentiary,--how it went with men there. He\\nknew how in these long years he should slowly die, but not Until soul\\nand body had become corrupt and rotten,--how, when he came out, if he\\nlived to come, even the lowest of the mill-hands would jeer him,--how\\nhis hands would be weak, and his brain senseless and stupid. He believed\\nhe was almost that now. He put his hand to his head, with a puzzled,\\nweary look. It ached, his head, with thinking. He tried to quiet\\nhimself. It was only right, perhaps; he had done wrong. But was there\\nright or wrong for such as he? What was right\\'? And who had ever taught\\nhim? He thrust the whole matter away. A dark, cold quiet crept through\\nhis brain. It was all wrong; but let it be! It was nothing to him more\\nthan the others. Let it be!\\n\\nThe door grated, as Haley opened it.\\n\\n\"Come, my woman! Must lock up for t\\'night. Come, stir yerself!\"\\n\\nShe went up and took Hugh\\'s hand.\\n\\n\"Good-night, Deb,\" he said, carelessly.\\n\\nShe had not hoped he would say more; but the Sired pain on her mouth\\njust then was bitterer than death. She took his passive hand and kissed\\nit.\\n\\n\"Hur \\'ll never see Deb again!\" she ventured, her lips growing colder and\\nmore bloodless.\\n\\nWhat did she say that for? Did he not know it\\'! Yet he would not\\nimpatient with poor old Deb. She had trouble of her own, as well as he.\\n\\n\"No, never again,\" he said, trying to be cheerful.\\n\\nShe stood just a moment, looking at him. Do you laugh at her, standing\\nthere, with her hunchback, her rags, her bleared, withered face, and the\\ngreat despised love tugging at her heart?\\n\\n\"Come, you!\" called Haley, impatiently.\\n\\nShe did not move.\\n\\n\"Hugh!\" she whispered.\\n\\nIt was to be her last word. What was it?\\n\\n\"Hugh, boy, not THAT!\"\\n\\nHe did not answer. She wrung her hands, trying to be silent, looking in\\nhis face in an agony of entreaty. He smiled again, kindly.\\n\\n\"It is best, Deb. I cannot bear to be hurted any more.\"\\n\\n\"Hur knows,\" she said, humbly.\\n\\n\"Tell my father good-bye; and--and kiss little Janey.\"\\n\\nShe nodded, saying nothing, looked in his face again, and went out of\\nthe door. As she went, she staggered.\\n\\n\"Drinkin\\' to-day?\" broke out Haley, pushing her before him. \"Where the\\nDevil did you get it? Here, in with ye!\" and he shoved her into her\\ncell, next to Wolfe\\'s, and shut the door.\\n\\nAlong the wall of her cell there was a crack low down by the floor,\\nthrough which she could see the light from Wolfe\\'s. She had discovered\\nit days before. She hurried in now, and, kneeling down by it, listened,\\nhoping to hear some sound. Nothing but the rasping of the tin on the\\nbars. He was at his old amusement again. Something in the noise jarred\\non her ear, for she shivered as she heard it. Hugh rasped away at the\\nbars. A dull old bit of tin, not fit to cut korl with.\\n\\nHe looked out of the window again. People were leaving the market now.\\nA tall mulatto girl, following her mistress, her basket on her head,\\ncrossed the street just below, and looked up. She was laughing; but,\\nwhen she caught sight of the haggard face peering out through the bars,\\nsuddenly grew grave, and hurried by. A free, firm step, a clear-cut\\nolive face, with a scarlet turban tied on one side, dark, shining eyes,\\nand on the head the basket poised, filled with fruit and flowers, under\\nwhich the scarlet turban and bright eyes looked out half-shadowed. The\\npicture caught his eye. It was good to see a face like that. He would\\ntry to-morrow, and cut one like it. _To-morrow_! He threw down the tin,\\ntrembling, and covered his face with his hands. When he looked up again,\\nthe daylight was gone.\\n\\nDeborah, crouching near by on the other side of the wall, heard no\\nnoise. He sat on the side of the low pallet, thinking. Whatever was the\\nmystery which the woman had seen on his face, it came out now slowly, in\\nthe dark there, and became fixed,--a something never seen on his face\\nbefore. The evening was darkening fast. The market had been over for an\\nhour; the rumbling of the carts over the pavement grew more infrequent:\\nhe listened to each, as it passed, because he thought it was to be for\\nthe last time. For the same reason, it was, I suppose, that he strained\\nhis eyes to catch a glimpse of each passer-by, wondering who they were,\\nwhat kind of homes they were going to, if they had children,--listening\\neagerly to every chance word in the street, as if--(God be merciful to\\nthe man! what strange fancy was this?)--as if he never should hear human\\nvoices again.\\n\\nIt was quite dark at last. The street was a lonely one. The last\\npassenger, he thought, was gone. No,--there was a quick step: Joe Hill,\\nlighting the I Joe was a good old chap; never passed a fellow without\\nsome joke or other. He remembered once seeing the place where he lived\\nwith his wife. \"Granny Hill\" the boys called her. Bedridden she was; but\\nso kind as Joe was to her! kept the room so clean!--and the old woman,\\nwhen he was there, was laughing at \"some of t\\' lad\\'s foolishness.\" The\\nstep was far down the street; but he could see him place the ladder, run\\nup, and light the gas. A longing seized him to be spoken to once more.\\n\\n\"Joe!\" he called, out of the grating. \"Good-bye, Joe!\"\\n\\nThe old man stopped a moment, listening uncertainly; then hurried on.\\nThe prisoner thrust his hand out of the window, and called again,\\nlouder; but Joe was too far down the street. It was a little thing; but\\nit hurt him,--this disappointment.\\n\\n\"Good-bye, Joe!\" he called, sorrowfully enough.\\n\\n\"Be quiet!\" said one of the jailers, passing the door, striking on it\\nwith his club.\\n\\nOh, that was the last, was it?\\n\\nThere was an inexpressible bitterness on his face, as he lay down on the\\nbed, taking the bit of tin, which he had rasped to a tolerable degree\\nof sharpness, in his hand,--to play with, it may be. He bared his arms,\\nlooking intently at their corded veins and sinews. Deborah, listening in\\nthe next cell, heard a slight clicking sound, often repeated. She shut\\nher lips tightly, that she might not scream; the cold drops of sweat\\nbroke over her, in her dumb agony.\\n\\n\"Hur knows best,\" she muttered at last, fiercely clutching the boards\\nwhere she lay.\\n\\nIf she could have seen Wolfe, there was nothing about him to frighten\\nher. He lay quite still, his arms outstretched, looking at the pearly\\nstream of moonlight coming into the window. I think in that one hour\\nthat came then he lived back over all the years that had gone before.\\nI think that all the low, vile life, all his wrongs, all his starved\\nhopes, came then, and stung him with a farewell poison that made him\\nsick unto death. He made neither moan nor cry, only turned his worn face\\nnow and then to the pure light, that seemed so far off, as one that\\nsaid, \"How long, O Lord? how long?\"\\n\\nThe hour was over at last. The moon, passing over her nightly path,\\nslowly came nearer, and threw the light across his bed on his feet. He\\nwatched it steadily, as it crept up, inch by inch, slowly. It seemed to\\nhim to carry with it a great silence. He had been so hot and tired there\\nalways in the mills! The years had been so fierce and cruel! There was\\ncoming now quiet and coolness and sleep. His tense limbs relaxed, and\\nsettled in a calm languor. The blood ran fainter and slow from his\\nheart. He did not think now with a savage anger of what might be and was\\nnot; he was conscious only of deep stillness creeping over him. At first\\nhe saw a sea of faces: the mill-men,--women he had known, drunken and\\nbloated,--Janeys timid and pitiful,--poor old Debs: then they floated\\ntogether like a mist, and faded away, leaving only the clear, pearly\\nmoonlight.\\n\\nWhether, as the pure light crept up the stretched-out figure, it brought\\nwith it calm and peace, who shall say? His dumb soul was alone with\\nGod in judgment. A Voice may have spoken for it from far-off Calvary,\\n\"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do!\" Who dare say?\\nFainter and fainter the heart rose and fell, slower and slower the moon\\nfloated from behind a cloud, until, when at last its full tide of white\\nsplendor swept over the cell, it seemed to wrap and fold into a deeper\\nstillness the dead figure that never should move again. Silence deeper\\nthan the Night! Nothing that moved, save the black, nauseous stream of\\nblood dripping slowly from the pallet to the floor!\\n\\nThere was outcry and crowd enough in the cell the next day. The coroner\\nand his jury, the local editors, Kirby himself, and boys with their\\nhands thrust knowingly into their pockets and heads on one side, jammed\\ninto the corners. Coming and going all day. Only one woman. She came\\nlate, and outstayed them all. A Quaker, or Friend, as they call\\nthemselves. I think this woman was known by that name in heaven. A\\nhomely body, coarsely dressed in gray and white. Deborah (for Haley had\\nlet her in) took notice of her. She watched them all--sitting on the\\nend of the pallet, holding his head in her arms--with the ferocity of\\na watch-dog, if any of them touched the body. There was no meekness,\\nsorrow, in her face; the stuff out of which murderers are made, instead.\\nAll the time Haley and the woman were laying straight the limbs and\\ncleaning the cell, Deborah sat still, keenly watching the Quaker\\'s face.\\nOf all the crowd there that day, this woman alone had not spoken to\\nher,--only once or twice had put some cordial to her lips. After they\\nall were gone, the woman, in the same still, gentle way, brought a vase\\nof wood-leaves and berries, and placed it by the pallet, then opened the\\nnarrow window. The fresh air blew in, and swept the woody fragrance over\\nthe dead face. Deborah looked up with a quick wonder.\\n\\n\"Did hur know my boy wud like it? Did hur know Hugh?\"\\n\\n\"I know Hugh now.\"\\n\\nThe white fingers passed in a slow, pitiful way over the dead, worn\\nface. There was a heavy shadow in the quiet eyes.\\n\\n\"Did hur know where they\\'ll bury Hugh?\" said Deborah in a shrill tone,\\ncatching her arm.\\n\\nThis had been the question hanging on her lips all day.\\n\\n\"In t\\' town-yard? Under t\\'mud and ash? T\\'lad \\'ll smother, woman! He wur\\nborn on t\\'lane moor, where t\\'air is frick and strong. Take hur out, for\\nGod\\'s sake, take hur out where t\\'air blows!\"\\n\\nThe Quaker hesitated, but only for a moment. She put her strong arm\\naround Deborah and led her to the window.\\n\\n\"Thee sees the hills, friend, over the river? Thee sees how the\\nlight lies warm there, and the winds of God blow all the day? I live\\nthere,--where the blue smoke is, by the trees. Look at me.\" She turned\\nDeborah\\'s face to her own, clear and earnest. \"Thee will believe me? I\\nwill take Hugh and bury him there to-morrow.\"\\n\\nDeborah did not doubt her. As the evening wore on, she leaned against\\nthe iron bars, looking at the hills that rose far off, through the thick\\nsodden clouds, like a bright, unattainable calm. As she looked, a shadow\\nof their solemn repose fell on her face: its fierce discontent faded\\ninto a pitiful, humble quiet. Slow, solemn tears gathered in her eyes:\\nthe poor weak eyes turned so hopelessly to the place where Hugh was to\\nrest, the grave heights looking higher and brighter and more solemn than\\never before. The Quaker watched her keenly. She came to her at last, and\\ntouched her arm.\\n\\n\"When thee comes back,\" she said, in a low, sorrowful tone, like one\\nwho speaks from a strong heart deeply moved with remorse or pity, \"thee\\nshall begin thy life again,--there on the hills. I came too late; but\\nnot for thee,--by God\\'s help, it may be.\"\\n\\nNot too late. Three years after, the Quaker began her work. I end my\\nstory here. At evening-time it was light. There is no need to tire\\nyou with the long years of sunshine, and fresh air, and slow, patient\\nChrist-love, needed to make healthy and hopeful this impure body and\\nsoul. There is a homely pine house, on one of these hills, whose windows\\noverlook broad, wooded <DW72>s and clover-crimsoned meadows,--niched into\\nthe very place where the light is warmest, the air freest. It is the\\nFriends\\' meeting-house. Once a week they sit there, in their grave,\\nearnest way, waiting for the Spirit of Love to speak, opening their\\nsimple hearts to receive His words. There is a woman, old, deformed, who\\ntakes a humble place among them: waiting like them: in her gray dress,\\nher worn face, pure and meek, turned now and then to the sky. A woman\\nmuch loved by these silent, restful people; more silent than they, more\\nhumble, more loving. Waiting: with her eyes turned to hills higher and\\npurer than these on which she lives,--dim and far off now, but to be\\nreached some day. There may be in her heart some latent hope to meet\\nthere the love denied her here,--that she shall find him whom she lost,\\nand that then she will not be all-unworthy. Who blames her? Something\\nis lost in the passage of every soul from one eternity to the\\nother,--something pure and beautiful, which might have been and was not:\\na hope, a talent, a love, over which the soul mourns, like Esau deprived\\nof his birthright. What blame to the meek Quaker, if she took her lost\\nhope to make the hills of heaven more fair?\\n\\nNothing remains to tell that the poor Welsh puddler once lived, but this\\nfigure of the mill-woman cut in korl. I have it here in a corner of my\\nlibrary. I keep it hid behind a curtain,--it is such a rough, ungainly\\nthing. Yet there are about it touches, grand sweeps of outline, that\\nshow a master\\'s hand. Sometimes,--to-night, for instance,--the curtain is\\naccidentally drawn back, and I see a bare arm stretched out imploringly\\nin the darkness, and an eager, wolfish face watching mine: a wan, woful\\nface, through which the spirit of the dead korl-cutter looks out, with\\nits thwarted life, its mighty hunger, its unfinished work. Its pale,\\nvague lips seem to tremble with a terrible question, \"Is this the End?\"\\nthey say,--\"nothing beyond?--no more?\"\\n\\nWhy, you tell me you have seen that look in the eyes of dumb\\nbrutes,--horses dying under the lash. I know.\\n\\nThe deep of the night is passing while I write. The gas-light wakens\\nfrom the shadows here and there the objects which lie scattered through\\nthe room: only faintly, though; for they belong to the open sunlight. As\\nI glance at them, they each recall some task or pleasure of the coming\\nday. A half-moulded child\\'s head; Aphrodite; a bough of forest-leaves;\\nmusic; work; homely fragments, in which lie the secrets of all eternal\\ntruth and beauty. Prophetic all! Only this dumb, woful face seems to\\nbelong to and end with the night. I turn to look at it Has the power of\\nits desperate need commanded the darkness away? While the room is yet\\nsteeped in heavy shadow, a cool, gray light suddenly touches its head\\nlike a blessing hand, and its groping arm points through the broken\\ncloud to the far East, where, in the nickering, nebulous crimson, God\\nhas set the promise of the Dawn.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nTHE REIGN OF KING COTTON.\\n\\n\\nTo every age and to all nations belong their peculiar maxims and\\npolitical or religious cries, which, if collected by some ingenious\\nphilosopher, would make a striking compendium of universal history.\\nSometimes a curious outward similarity exists between these condensed\\nnational sentences of peoples dissimilar in every other respect. Thus,\\nto-day is heard in the senescent East the oft-repeated formula of the\\nMussulman\\'s faith, \"There is no God but Allah, and Mahomet is his\\nProphet,\" while in the youthful West a new cry, as fully believed, not\\nless devout, and scarcely less often repeated, arises from one great\\nand influential portion of the political and social thinkers of this\\ncountry,--the cry that \"There is no King but Cotton, and the African is\\nits High-Priest.\" According to the creed of philosophy, philanthropy,\\nand economy in vogue among the sect whose views take utterance in this\\nformula, King Cotton has now reigned supreme over the temporal affairs\\nof the princes, potentates, and people of this earth for some thirty\\nyears. Consequently, it is fair to presume that its reign has fully\\ndeveloped its policy and tendencies and is producing its fruit for good\\nor evil, especially in the land of its disciples. It is well, therefore,\\nsometimes to withdraw a little from the dust and smoke of the battle,\\nwhich, with us at least, announces the spread of this potentate\\'s power,\\nand to try to disentangle the real questions at issue in the struggle\\nfrom the eternal complications produced by short-sighted politicians and\\npopular issues. Looking at the policy and tendency of the reign of King\\nCotton, as hitherto developed and indicated by its most confidential\\nadvisers and apostles and by the lapse of time in the so-called Slave\\nStates, to what end does it necessarily tend? to what results must it\\nlogically lead?\\n\\nWhat is coarsely, but expressively, described in the political slang of\\nthis country as \"_The Everlasting <DW65> Question_\" might perhaps fairly\\nbe considered exhausted as a topic of discussion, if ever a topic was.\\nIs it exhausted, however? Have not rather the smoke and sweat and dust\\nof the political battle in which we have been so long and so fiercely\\nengaged exercised a dimming influence on our eyes as to the true\\ndifficulty and its remedy, as they have on the vision of other angry\\ncombatants since the world began? It is easy to say, in days like these,\\nthat men seem at once to lose their judgment and reason when they\\napproach this question,--to look hardly an arm\\'s length before\\nthem,--to become mere tools of their own passions; and all this is true,\\nand, in conceding it all, no more is conceded than that the men of the\\npresent day are also mortal. How many voters in the last election,\\nbefore they went to the polls, had seriously thought out for themselves\\nthe real issue of the contest, apart from party names and platforms and\\npopular cries and passionate appeals to the conscience and the purse?\\nIn all parties, some doubtless were impelled by fanaticism,--many were\\nguided by instinct,--more by the voice of their leaders,--most by party\\ncatchwords and material interests,--but how many by real reflection and\\nthe exercise of reason? Was it every fifth man, or every tenth? Was it\\nevery fiftieth? Let every one judge for himself. The history of the\\nreigning dynasty, its policy and tendency, are still open questions, the\\ndiscussion of which, though perhaps become tedious, is not exhausted,\\nand, if conducted in a fair spirit, will at least do no harm. What,\\nthen, is all this thirty years\\' turmoil, of which the world is growing\\nsick, about? Are we indeed only fighting, as the party-leaders at the\\nNorth seem trying to persuade us, for the control, by the interests of\\nfree labor or of slave-labor, of certain remaining national territories\\ninto which probably slavery never could be made to enter?--or rather\\nis there not some deep innate principle,--some strong motive of\\naggrandizement or preservation,--some real Enceladus,--the cause of this\\nfurious volcano of destructive agitation? If, indeed, the struggle\\nbe for the possession of a sterile waste in the heart of the\\ncontinent,--useless either as a slave-breeding or a slave-working\\ncountry,--clearly, whatever the politician might say to the contrary,\\nthe patriot and the merchant would soon apply to the struggle the\\nprinciple, that sometimes the game is not worth the candle. If, however,\\nthere be an underlying principle, the case is different, and the cost of\\nthe struggle admits of no limit save the value of the motive principle.\\nHe who now pretends to discuss this question should approach it neither\\nas a Whig, a Democrat, nor a Republican, but should look at it by the\\nlight of political philosophy and economy, forgetful of the shibboleth\\nof party or appeals to passion. So far as may be, in this spirit it is\\nproposed to discuss it here.\\n\\n\"By its fruits ye shall know it.\" Look, then, for a moment, at the\\nfruits of the Cotton dynasty, as hitherto developed in the working of\\nits policy and its natural tendency,--observe its vital essence and\\nlogical necessities,--seek for the result of its workings, when brought\\nin contact with the vital spirits and life-currents of our original\\npolicy as a people,--and then decide whether this contest in which we\\nare engaged is indeed an irrepressible and inextinguishable contest,\\nor whether all this while we have not been fighting with shadows. King\\nCotton has now reigned for thirty years, be the same less or more. To\\nfeel sure that we know what its policy has wrought in that time, we must\\nfirst seek for the conditions under which it originally began its work.\\n\\nEver since Adam and Eve were forced, on their expulsion from Paradise,\\nto try the first experiment at self-government, their descendants have\\nbeen pursuing a course of homoeopathic treatment. It was the eating of\\nthe fruit of the tree of knowledge which caused all their woes; and\\nin an increased consumption of the fruit of that tree they have\\npersistently looked for alleviation of them. Experience seems to prove\\nthe wisdom of the treatment. The greater the consumption of the fruit,\\nthe greater the happiness of man. Knowledge has at last become the basis\\nof all things,--of power, of social standing, of material prosperity,\\nand, finally, in America, of government itself. Until within a century\\npast, political philosophy in the creation of government began at the\\nwrong end. It built from the pinnacle downward. The stability of the\\ngovernment depended on the apex,--the one or the few,--and not on the\\nbase,--the foundation of the many. At length, in this country, fresh\\nfrom the hand of Nature, the astonished world saw a new experiment\\ntried,--a government systematically built up from the foundation of\\nthe many,--a government drawing its being from, and dependent for its\\ncontinued existence on, the will and the intelligence of the governed.\\nThe foundation had first been laid deep and strong, and on it a goodly\\nsuperstructure of government was erected. Yet, even to this day, the\\nvery subjects of that government itself do not realize that they, and\\nnot the government, are the sources of national prosperity. In times of\\nnational emergency like the present,--amid clamors of secession and\\nof coercion,--angry threats and angrier replies,--wars and rumors of\\nwars,--what is more common than to hear sensible men--men whom the\\npeople look to as leaders--picturing forth a dire relapse into barbarism\\nand anarchy as the necessary consequence of the threatened convulsions?\\nThey forget, if they ever realized, that the people made this\\ngovernment, and not the government the people. Destroy the intelligence\\nof the people, and the government could not exist for a day;--destroy\\nthis government, and the people would create another, and yet another,\\nof no less perfect symmetry. While the foundations are firm, there need\\nbe no fears of the superstructure, which may be renewed again and again;\\nbut touch the foundations, and the superstructure must crumble at once.\\nThose who still insist on believing that this government made the people\\nare fond of triumphantly pointing to the condition of the States of\\nMexico, as telling the history of our own future, let our present\\ngovernment be once interrupted in its functions. Are Mexicans Yankees?\\nAre Spaniards Anglo-Saxons? Are Catholicism and religious freedom, the\\nInquisition and common schools, despotism and democracy, synonymous\\nterms? Could a successful republic, on our model, be at once instituted\\nin Africa on the assassination of the King of Timbuctoo? Have two\\ncenturies of education nothing to do with our success, or an eternity of\\nignorance with Mexican failure? Was our government a lucky guess, and\\ntheirs an unfortunate speculation? The one lesson that America is\\ndestined to teach the world, or to miss her destiny in failing to teach,\\nhas with us passed into a truism, and is yet continually lost sight of;\\nit is the magnificent result of three thousand years of experiment: the\\nsimple truth, that no government is so firm, so truly conservative, and\\nso wholly indestructible, as a government founded and dependent for\\nsupport upon the affections and good-will of a moral, intelligent, and\\neducated community. In our politics, we hear much of State-rights and\\ncentralization,--of distribution of power,--of checks and balances,--of\\nconstitutions and their construction,--of patronage and its\\ndistribution,--of banks, of tariffs, and of trade,--all of them subjects\\nof moment in their sphere; but their sphere is limited. Whether they be\\ndecided one way or the other is of comparatively little consequence:\\nfor, however they are decided, if the people are educated and informed,\\nthe government will go on, and the community be prosperous, be they\\ndecided never so badly,--and if decided badly, the decision will he\\nreversed; but let the people become ignorant and debased, and all the\\nchecks and balances and wise regulations which the ingenuity of man\\ncould in centuries devise would, at best, but for a short space defer\\nthe downfall of a republic. A well-founded republic can, then, be\\ndestroyed only by destroying its people,--its decay need be looked for\\nonly in the decay of their intelligence; and any form of thought or\\nany institution tending to suppress education or destroy intelligence\\nstrikes at the very essence of the government, and constitutes a treason\\nwhich no law can meet, and for which no punishment is adequate.\\n\\nEducation, then, as universally diffused as the elements of God, is the\\nlife-blood of our body politic. The intelligence of the people is the\\none great fact of our civilization and our prosperity,--it is the\\nbeating heart of our age and of our land. It is education alone which\\nmakes equality possible without anarchy, and liberty without license. It\\nis this--which makes the fundamental principles of our Declaration of\\nIndependence living realities in New England, while in France they still\\nremain the rhetorical statement of glittering generalities. From this\\nsource flow all our possibilities. Without it, the equality of man is a\\npretty figure of speech; with it, democracy is possible. This is a path\\nbeaten by two hundred years of footprints, and while we walk it we are\\nsafe and need fear no evil; but if we diverge from it, be it for never\\nso little, we stumble, and, unless we quickly retrace our steps, we fall\\nand are lost. The tutelary goddess of American liberty should be the\\npure marble image of the Professor\\'s Yankee school-mistress. Education\\nis the fundamental support of our system. It was education which made us\\nfree, progressive, and conservative; and it is education alone which can\\nkeep us so.\\n\\nWith this fact clearly established, the next inquiry should be as to\\nthe bearing and policy of the Cotton dynasty as touching this\\nquestion of general intelligence. It is a mere truism to say that the\\ncotton-culture is the cause of the present philosophical and economical\\nphase of the African question. Throughout the South, whether justly or\\nnot, it is considered as well settled that cotton can be profitably\\nraised only by a forced system of labor. This theory has been denied by\\nsome writers, and, in experience, is certainly subject to some marked\\nexceptions; but undoubtedly it is the creed of the Cotton dynasty,\\nand must here, therefore, be taken for true.[A] With this theory, the\\nSouthern States are under a direct inducement, in the nature of a bribe,\\nto the amount of the annual profit on their cotton-crop, to see as\\nmany perfections and as few imperfections as possible in the system of\\nAfrican slavery, and to follow it out unflinchingly into all its logical\\nnecessities. Thus, under the direct influence of the Cotton dynasty, the\\nwhole Southern tone on this subject has undergone a change. Slavery is\\nno longer deplored as a necessary evil, but it is maintained as in\\nall respects a substantial good. One of the logical necessities of a\\nthorough slave-system is, in at least the slave-portion of the people,\\nextreme ignorance. Whatever theoretically may be desirable in this\\nrespect among the master-class, ignorance, in its worst form,--ignorance\\nof everything except the use of the tools with which their work is to\\nbe done,--is the necessary condition of the slaves. But it is said that\\nslaves are property, without voice or influence in the government, and\\nthat the ignorance of the black is no obstacle to the intelligence\\nof the white. This possibly may be true; but a government founded on\\nignorance, as the essential condition of one portion of its people, is\\nnot likely long to regard education as its vital source and essence.\\nStill the assertion that the rule of education does not apply to slaves\\nmust be allowed; for we must deal with facts as we find them; and\\nundoubtedly the slave has no rights which the master is bound to\\nrespect; and in speaking of the policy of the Cotton dynasty, the\\nservile population must be regarded as it is, ignoring the question of\\nwhat it might be; it must be taken into consideration only as a terrible\\ninert mass of domesticated barbarism, and there left. The question\\nhere is solely with the policy and tendency of the Cotton dynasty\\nas affecting the master-class, and the servile class is in that\\nconsideration to be summarily disposed of as so much labor owned by so\\nmuch capital.\\n\\n[Footnote A: \"In truth,\" the institution of slavery, as an agency for\\ncotton-cultivation, \"is an expensive luxury, a dangerous and artificial\\nstate, and, even in a-worldly point of view, an error. The cost of a\\nfirst-class <DW64> in the United States is about L800, and the interest\\non the capital invested in and the wear and tear of this human chattel\\nare equal to 10 per cent., which, with the cost of maintaining,\\nclothing, and doctoring him, or another 5 per cent, gives an annual cost\\nof L45; and the pampered Coolies in the best paying of all the tropical\\nsettlements, Trinidad, receive wages that do not exceed on an average\\non the year round 6s. per week, or about two-fifths, while in the East\\nIndies, with perquisites, they do not receive so much as two-thirds of\\nthis. In Cuba, the Chinese emigrants do not receive so much even as\\none-third of this.\"--_Cotton Trade of Great Britain_, by J.A. MANN.\\n--In India, labor is 80 per cent cheaper than in the United States.]\\n\\nThe dynasty of Cotton is based on the monopoly of the cotton-culture in\\nthe Cotton States of the Union; its whole policy is directed to the two\\nends of making the most of and retaining that monopoly; and economically\\nit reduces everything to subserviency to the question of cotton-supply;\\n--thus Cotton is King. The result necessarily is, that the Cotton States\\nhave turned all their energies to that one branch of industry. All other\\nbranches they abandon or allow to languish. They have no commerce of\\ntheir own, few manufactories, fewer arts; and in their abandonment of\\nself in their devotion to their King, they do not even raise their\\nown hay or corn, dig their own coal, or fell their own timber; and at\\npresent, Louisiana is abandoning the sugar-culture, one of the few\\nremaining exports of the South, to share more largely in the monopoly of\\ncotton. Thus the community necessarily loses its fair proportions; it\\nceases to be self-sustaining; it exercises one faculty alone, until all\\nthe others wither and become impotent for very lack of use. This intense\\nand all-pervading devotion to one pursuit, and that a pursuit to which\\nthe existence of a servile class is declared essential, must, in a\\nrepublic more than in any other government, produce certain marked\\npolitico-philosophical and economical effects on the master-class as a\\nwhole. In a country conducted on a system of servile labor, as in one\\nconducted on free, the master-class must be divided into the two great\\norders of the rich and poor,--those who have, and those who have not.\\nThat the whole policy of the Cotton dynasty tends necessarily to making\\nbroader the chasm between these orders is most apparent. It makes the\\nrich richer, and the poor poorer; for, as, according to the creed of the\\ndynasty, capital should own labor, and the labor thus owned can alone\\nsuccessfully produce cotton, he who has must be continually increasing\\nhis store, while he who has not can neither raise the one staple\\nrecognized by the Cotton dynasty, nor turn his labor, his only property,\\nto other branches of industry; for such have, in the universal\\nabandonment of the community to cotton, been allowed to languish and\\ndie. The economical tendency of the Cotton dynasty is therefore to\\ndivide the master-class yet more distinctly into the two great opposing\\norders of society. On the one hand we see the capitalist owning the\\nlabor of a thousand slaves, and on the other the laboring white unable,\\nunder the destructive influence of a profitable monopoly, to make any\\nuse of that labor which is his only property.\\n\\nWhat influence, then, has the Cotton dynasty on that portion of the\\nmaster-class who are without capital? Its tendency has certainly\\nnecessarily been to make their labor of little value; but they are still\\ncitizens of a republic, free to come and go, and, in the eye of the law,\\nequal with the highest;--on them, in times of emergency, the government\\nmust rest; their education and intelligence are its only sure\\nfoundations. But, having made this class the vast majority of the\\nmaster-caste, what are the policy and tendency of the Cotton dynasty\\nas touching them? The story is almost too old to bear even the\\nshortest repetition. Philosophically, it is a logical necessity\\nof the Cotton dynasty that it should be opposed to universal\\nintelligence;--economically, it renders universal intelligence an\\nimpossibility. That slavery is in itself a positive good to society is\\na fundamental doctrine of the Cotton dynasty, and a proposition\\nnot necessary to be combated here; but, unfortunately, universal\\nintelligence renders free discussion a necessity, and experience tells\\nus that the suppression of free discussion is necessary to the existence\\nof slavery. We are but living history over again. The same causes have\\noften existed before, and they have drawn after them the necessary\\neffects. Other peoples, at other times, as well as our Southern brethren\\nat present, have felt, that the suppression of general discussion was\\nnecessary to the preservation of a prized and peculiar institution.\\nSpain, Italy, Germany, France, the Netherlands, England, and Scotland\\nhave all, at different times, experienced the forced suppression of\\nsome one branch of political or religious thought. Their histories have\\nrecorded the effect of that suppression; and the rule to be deduced\\ntherefrom is simply this: If the people among whom such suppression is\\nattempted are ignorant, and are kept so as part of a system, the attempt\\nmay be successful, though in its results working destruction to\\nthe community;--if, however, they are intelligent, and the system\\nincautiously admits into itself any plan of education, the attempt\\nat suppression will be abandoned, as the result either of policy or\\nviolence. In this respect, then, on philosophical grounds, the Cotton\\ndynasty is not likely to favor the education of the masses. Again, it\\nis undoubtedly the interest of the man who has not, that all possible\\nbranches of industry should be open to his labor, as rendering that\\nlabor of greater value; but the whole tendency of the Cotton monopoly is\\nto blight all branches of industry in the Cotton States save only that\\none. General intelligence might lead the poor white to suspect this fact\\nof an interest of his own antagonistic to the policy of the Cotton King,\\nand therefore general intelligence is not part of that monarch\\'s policy.\\nThis the philosophers of the Cotton dynasty fairly avow and class high\\namong those dangers against which it behooves them to be on their guard.\\nThey theorize thus:--\\n\\n\"The great mass of our poor white population begin to understand that\\nthey have rights, and that they, too, are entitled to some of the\\nsympathy which falls upon the suffering. They are fast learning that\\nthere is an almost infinite world of industry opening before them, by\\nwhich they can elevate themselves and their families from wretchedness\\nand ignorance to competence and intelligence. It is this great upheaving\\nof our masses which we have to fear, so far as our institutions are\\nconcerned.\"[B]\\n\\n[Footnote B: _De Bow\\'s Review_, January, 1850. Quoted in Olmsted\\'s _Back\\nCountry_, p. 451.]\\n\\nFurther, the policy of the Cotton King, however honestly in theory it\\nmay wish to encourage it, renders general education and consequent\\nintelligence an impossibility. A system of universal education is made\\nfor a laboring population, and can be sustained only among a laboring\\npopulation; but if that population consist of slaves, universal\\neducation cannot exist. The reason is simple; for the children of all\\nmust be educated, otherwise the scholars will not support the schools.\\nIt is an absolute necessity of society that in agricultural districts\\ncultivated by slave-labor the free population should be too sparsely\\nscattered to support a system of schools, even on starvation wages for\\nthe cheapest class of teachers.\\n\\nFinally, though it is a subject not necessary now to discuss, the effect\\nof the Cotton monopoly and dynasty in depressing the majority of the\\nwhites into a species of labor competition in the same branch of\\nindustry as the blacks, because the only branch open to all, can\\nhardly have a self-respect-inspiring influence on that portion of the\\ncommunity, but should in its results rather illustrate old Falstaff\\'s\\nremark,--that \"there is a thing often heard of, and it is known to many\\nin our land, by the name of pitch; this pitch, as ancient writers do\\nreport, doth defile: so doth the company thou keepest.\"\\n\\nSuch, reason tells us, should be the effect on the intelligence and\\neducation of the free masses of the South of the policy and dynasty of\\nKing Cotton. That experience in this case verifies the conclusions\\nof reason who can doubt who has ever set foot in a thorough Slave\\nState,--or in Kansas, or in any Free State half-peopled by the poor\\nwhites of the South?--or who can doubt it, that has ever even talked on\\nthe subject with an intelligent and fair-minded Southern gentleman? Who\\nthat knows them will deny that the poor whites of the South make the\\nworst population in the country? Who ever heard a Southern gentleman\\nspeak of them, save in Congress or on the hustings, otherwise than with\\naversion and contempt?[C]\\n\\n[Footnote C: Except when used by the accomplished statistician, there is\\nnothing more fallacious than the figures of the census. As the author of\\nthis article is a disciple neither of Buckle nor De Bow, they have not\\nbeen used at all; but a few of the census figures are nevertheless\\ninstructive, as showing the difference between the Free and the Servile\\nStates in respect to popular education. According to the census of 1850,\\nthe white population of the Slave States amounted to 6,184,477 souls,\\nand the <DW52> population, free and slave, brought the total population\\nup to an aggregate of 9,612,979, of which the whole number of\\nschool-pupils was 581,861. New York, with a population of 3,097,894\\nsouls, numbered 675,221 pupils, or 98,830 more than all the Slave\\nStates. The eight Cotton States, from South Carolina to Arkansas, with\\na population of 2,137,264 whites and a grand total of 3,970,337 human\\nbeings, contained 141,032 pupils; the State of Massachusetts, with a\\ntotal population of 994,514, numbered 176,475, or 35,443 pupils more\\nthan all the Cotton States. In popular governments the great sources\\nof general intelligence are newspapers and periodicals; in estimating\\nthese, metropolitan New York should not be considered; but of these\\nthe whole number, in 1850, issued annually in all the Slave States was\\n61,038,698, and the number in the not peculiarly enlightened State of\\nPennsylvania was 84,898,672, or 3,859,974 more than in all the Slave\\nStates. In the eight Cotton States, the whole number was 30,041,991; and\\nin the single State of Massachusetts, 64,820,564, or 34,778,573 more,\\nand in the single State of Ohio, 30,473,407, or 431,416 more, than in\\nall the above eight States.]\\n\\nHere, then, we come at once to the foundation of a policy and the cause\\nof this struggle. Whether it will or no, it is the inevitable tendency\\nof the Cotton dynasty to be opposed to general intelligence. It is\\nopposed to that, then, without which a republic cannot hope to exist;\\nit is opposed to and denies the whole results of two thousand years of\\nexperience. The social system of which the government of to-day is\\nthe creature is founded on the principle of a generally diffused\\nintelligence of the people; but if now Cotton be King, as is so boldly\\nasserted, then an influence has obtained control of the government of\\nwhich the whole policy is in direct antagonism with, the very elementary\\nideas of that government. History tells us that eight bags of cotton\\nimported into England in 1784 were seized by the custom-house officers\\nat Liverpool, on the ground that so much cotton could not have been\\nproduced in these States. In 1860, the cotton-crop was estimated at\\n3,851,481 bales. Thus King Cotton was born with this government, and\\nhas strengthened with its strength; and to-day, almost the creature of\\ndestiny, sent to work the failure of our experiment as a people, it has\\nled almost one-half of the Republic to completely ignore, if not to\\nreject, the one principle absolutely essential to that Republic\\'s\\ncontinued existence. What two thousand years ago was said of Rome\\napplies to us:--\"Those abuses and corruptions which in time destroy a\\ngovernment are sown along with the very seeds of it and both grow up\\ntogether; and as rust eats away iron, and worms devour wood, and both\\nare a sort of plagues born and bred with the substance they destroy; so\\nwith every form and scheme of government that man can invent, some vice\\nor corruption creeps in with the very institution, which grows up along\\nwith and at last destroys it.\" No wonder, then, that the conflict\\nis irrepressible and hot; for two instinctive principles of\\nself-preservation have met in deadly conflict: the South, with the eager\\nloyalty of the Cavalier, rallies to the standard of King Cotton, while\\nthe North, with the earnest devotion of the Puritan, struggles hard in\\ndefence of the fundamental principles of its liberties and the ark of\\nits salvation.\\n\\nThus over nearly half of the national domain and among a large minority\\nof the citizens of the Republic, the dynasty of Cotton has worked a\\ndivergence from original principle. Wherever the sway of King Cotton\\nextends, the people have for the present lost sight of the most\\nessential of our national attributes. They are seeking to found a great\\nand prosperous republic on the cultivation of a single staple product,\\nand not on intelligence universally diffused: consequently they\\nhave founded their house upon the sand. Among them, cotton, and\\nnot knowledge, is power. When thus reduced to its logical\\nnecessities,--brought down, as it were, to the hard pan,--the experience\\nof two thousand years convincingly proves that their experiment as a\\ndemocracy must fail. It is, then, a question of vital importance to\\nthe whole people,--How can this divergence be terminated? Is there any\\nresult, any agency, which can destroy this dynasty, and restore us as a\\npeople to the firm foundations upon which our experiment was begun? Can\\nthe present agitation effect this result? If it could, the country might\\njoyfully bid a long farewell to \"the canker of peace,\" and \"hail the\\nblood-red blossom of war with a heart of fire\"; but the sad answer, that\\nit cannot, whether resulting in the successor Democrat or Republican,\\nseems almost too evident for discussion. The present conflict is good so\\nfar as it goes, but it touches only the surface of things. It is well to\\ndrive the Cotton dynasty from the control of the national government;\\nbut the aims of the Republican party can reach no farther, even if it\\nmeet with complete success in that. But even that much is doubtful. The\\ndanger at this point is one ever recurring. Those Northern politicians,\\nwho, in pursuit of their political objects and ambition, unreservedly\\nbind up their destinies with those of the Cotton dynasty,--the Issachars\\nof the North, whose strong backs are bowed to receive any burden,--the\\nmen who in the present conflict will see nought but the result of the\\nmaudlin sentimentality of fanatics and the empty cries of ambitious\\ndemagogues,--are not mistaken in their calculations. While Cotton is\\nKing, as it now is, nothing but time or its own insanity can permanently\\nshake its hold on the national policy. In moments of fierce convulsion,\\nas at present, the North, like a restive steed, may contest its\\nsupremacy. Let the South, however, bend, not break, before the storm,\\nand history is indeed \"a nurse\\'s tale,\" if the final victory does not\\nrest with the party of unity and discipline. While the monopoly of\\ncotton exists with the South, and it is cultivated exclusively by native\\nAfrican labor, the national government will as surely tend, in spite of\\nall momentarily disturbing influences, towards a united South as the\\nneedle to the pole. But even if the government were permanently wrested\\nfrom its control, would the evil be remedied? Surely not. The disease\\nwhich is sapping the foundations of our liberty is not eradicated\\nbecause its workings are forced inward. What remedy is that which leaves\\na false and pernicious policy--a policy in avowed war with the whole\\nspirit of our civilization and in open hostility to our whole experiment\\nas a government--in full working, almost a religious creed with near\\none-half of our people? As a remedy, this would be but a quack medicine\\nat the best. The cure must be a more thorough one. The remedy we must\\nlook for--the only one which can meet the exigencies of the case--must\\nbe one which will restore to the South the attributes of a democracy. It\\nmust cause our Southern brethren of their own free will to reverse their\\nsteps,--to return from their divergence. It must teach them a purer\\nChristianity, a truer philosophy, a sounder economy. It must lead them\\nto new paths of industry. It must gently persuade them that a true\\nnational prosperity is not the result of a total abandonment of\\nthe community to the culture of one staple. It must make them\\nself-dependent, so that no longer they shall have to import their\\ncorn from the Northwest, their lumber-men and hay from Maine, their\\nmanufactures from Massachusetts, their minerals from Pennsylvania, and\\nto employ the shipping of the world. Finally, it must make it impossible\\nfor one overgrown interest to plunge the whole community unresistingly\\ninto frantic rebellion or needless war. They must learn that a\\nwell-conditioned state is, so far as may be, perfect in itself,--and,\\nto be perfect in itself, must be intelligent and free. When these\\nlessons are taught to the South, then will their divergence cease,\\nand they will enter upon a new path of enjoyment, prosperity, and\\npermanence. The world at present pays them an annual bribe of some\\n$65,000,000 to learn none of these lessons. Their material interest\\nteaches them to bow down to the shrine of King Cotton. Here, then, lies\\nthe remedy with the disease. The prosperity of the country in general,\\nand of the South in particular, demands that the reign of King Cotton\\nshould cease,--that his dynasty should be destroyed. This result can\\nbe obtained but in one way, and that seemingly ruinous. The present\\nmonopoly in their great staple commodity enjoyed by the South must be\\ndestroyed, and forever. This result every patriot and well-wisher of the\\nSouth should ever long for; and yet, by every Southern statesman and\\nphilosopher, it is regarded as the one irremediable evil possible to\\ntheir country. What miserable economy! what feeble foresight! What\\nprinciple of political economy is better established than that a\\nmonopoly is a curse to both producer and consumer? To the first it pays\\na premium on fraud, sloth, and negligence; and to the second it supplies\\nthe worst possible article, in the worst possible way, at the highest\\npossible price. In agriculture, in manufactures, in the professions, and\\nin the arts, it is the greatest bar to improvement with which any branch\\nof industry can be cursed. The South is now showing to the world an\\nexample of a great people borne down, crushed to the ground, cursed, by\\na monopoly. A fertile country of magnificent resources, inhabited by a\\ngreat race, of inexhaustible energy, is abandoned to one pursuit;--the\\nvery riches of their position are as a pestilence to their prosperity.\\nIn the presence of their great monopoly, science, art, manufactures,\\nmining, agriculture,--word, all the myriad branches of industry\\nessential to the true prosperity of a state,--wither and die, that\\nsanded cotton may be produced by the most costly of labor. For love of\\ncotton, the very intelligence of the community, the life-blood of their\\npolity, is disregarded and forgotten. Hence it is that the marble and\\nfreestone quarries of New England alone are far more important sources\\nof revenue than all the subterranean deposits of the Servile States.\\nThus the monopoly which is the apparent source of their wealth is in\\nreality their greatest curse; for it blinds them to the fact, that, with\\nnations as with individuals, a healthy competition is the one essential\\nto all true economy and real excellence. Monopolists are always blind,\\nalways practise a false economy. Adam Smith tells us that \"it is not\\nmore than fifty years ago that some of the counties in the neighborhood\\nof London petitioned the Parliament against the extension of the\\nturnpike roads into the remoter counties. Those remoter counties, they\\npretended, from the cheapness of labor, would be able to sell their\\ngrass and corn cheaper in the London market than themselves, and would\\nthereby reduce their rents and ruin their cultivation.\" The great\\neconomist significantly adds,--\"Their rents, however, have risen, and\\ntheir cultivation has been improved, since that time.\" Finally, to-day,\\nwould the cultivation of cereals in the Northwest be improved, if made\\na monopoly? would its inhabitants be richer? would their economy be\\nbetter? Certainly not. Yet to-day they undersell the world, and, in\\nspite of competition, are far richer, far more contented and prosperous,\\nthan their fellow-citizens in the South in the full enjoyment of their\\nboasted dynasty of Cotton.\\n\\n\"Here,\" said Wellington, on the Eton football ground, \"we won the battle\\nof Waterloo.\" Not in angry declamation and wordy debate, in threats of\\nsecession and cries for coercion, amid the clash of party-politics, the\\nwindy declamation of blatant politicians, or the dirty scramble for\\noffice, is the destruction of the dynasty of King Cotton to be looked\\nfor. The laws of trade must be the great teacher; and here, as\\nelsewhere, England, the noble nation of shopkeepers, must be the agent\\nfor the fulfilment of those laws. It is safe to-day to say, that,\\nthrough the agency of England, and, in accordance with those laws, under\\na continuance of the present profit on that staple, the dynasty of King\\nCotton is doomed,--the monopoly which is now the basis of his power will\\nbe a monopoly no more. If saved at all from the blight of this\\nmonopoly, the South will be saved, not in New York or Boston, but in\\nLiverpool,--not by the thinkers of America, but by the merchants of\\nEngland. The real danger of the Cotton dynasty lies not in the hostility\\nof the North, but in the exigencies of the market abroad; they struggle\\nnot against the varying fortunes of political warfare, but against the\\nirreversible decrees of Fate. It is the old story of the Rutulian hero;\\nand now, in the very crisis and agony of the battle, while the Cotton\\nKing is summoning all his resources and straining every nerve to cope\\nsuccessfully with its more apparent, but less formidable adversary, in\\nthe noisy struggle for temporary power, if it would listen for a moment\\nto the voice of reason, and observe the still working of the laws of our\\nbeing, it, too, might see cause to abandon the contest, with the\\nangry lament, that, not by its opponent was it vanquished, but by the\\nhostility of Jupiter and the gods. The operation of the laws of\\ntrade, as touching this monopoly, is beautifully simple. Already the\\nindications are sufficient to tell us, that, under the sure, but\\nsilent working of those laws, the very profits of the Southern planter\\nforeshadow the destruction of his monopoly. His dynasty rests upon the\\ntheory, that his <DW64> is the only practical agency for the production\\nof his staple. But the supply of African labor is limited, and the\\nincreased profit on cotton renders the cost of that labor heavier in\\nits turn,--the value of the <DW64> rising one hundred dollars for every\\nadditional cent of profit on a pound of cotton. The increased cost of\\nthe labor increases the cost of producing the cotton. The result is\\nclear; and the history of the cotton-trade has twice verified it. The\\nincreased profits on the staple tempt competition, and, in the increased\\ncost of production, render it possible. Two courses only are open to the\\nSouth: either to submit to the destruction of their monopoly, or to try\\nto retain it by a cheaper supply of labor. They now feel the pressure of\\nthe dilemma; and hence the cry to reopen the slave-trade. According to\\nthe iron policy of their dynasty, they must inundate their country with\\nfreshly imported barbarism, or compete with the world. They cry out for\\nmore Africans; and to their cry the voice of the civilized world returns\\nits veto. The policy of King Cotton forces them to turn from the\\ndaylight of free labor now breaking in Texas. On the other hand, it is\\nnot credible that all the land adapted to the growth of the cotton-plant\\nis confined to America; and, at the present value of the commodity, the\\nland adapted to its growth would be sought out and used, though buried\\nnow in the jungles of India, the wellnigh impenetrable wildernesses of\\nAfrica, the table-lands of South America, or the islands of the Pacific.\\nAlready the organized energy of England has pushed its explorations,\\nunder Livingstone, Barth, and Clegg, into regions hitherto unknown.\\nAlready, under the increased consumption, one-third of the cotton\\nconsumed at Liverpool is the product of climes other than our own.\\nHundreds of miles of railroad in India are opening to the market vast\\nregions to share in our profits and break down our monopoly. To-day,\\nIndia, for home-consumption and exportation, produces twice the amount\\nof cotton produced in America; and, under the increased profit of late\\nyears, the importation into England from that country has risen from\\n12,324,200 pounds in 1830, to 77,011,839 pounds in 1840, and, finally,\\nto 250,338,144 pounds in 1857, or nearly twenty per cent of the whole\\namount imported, and more than one-fourth of the whole amount imported\\nfrom America. The staple there produced does not, indeed, compare in\\nquality with our own; but this remark does not apply to the staple\\nproduced in Africa,--the original home of the cotton-plant, as of the\\n<DW64>,--or to that of the cotton-producing islands of the Pacific. The\\ninexhaustible fertility of the valley of the Nile--producing, with a\\nsingle exception, the finest cotton of the world,--lying on the same\\nlatitude as the cotton-producing States of America, and overflowing\\nwith unemployed labor--will find its profit, at present prices, in the\\nabandonment of the cultivation of corn, its staple product since the\\ndays of Joseph, to come in competition with the monopoly of the South.\\nPeru, Australia, Cuba, Jamaica, and even the Feejee Islands, all are\\npreparing to enter the lists. And, finally, the interior of Africa, the\\ngreat unknown and unexplored land, which for centuries has baffled the\\nenterprise of travellers, seems about to make known her secrets under\\nthe persuasive arguments of trade, and to make her cotton, and not her\\nchildren, her staple export in the future. In the last fact is to be\\nseen a poetic justice. Africa, outraged, scorned, down-trodden, is,\\nperhaps, to drag down forever the great enslaver of her offspring.\\n\\nThus the monopoly of King Cotton hangs upon a thread. Its profits must\\nfall, or it must cease to exist. If subject to no disturbing influence,\\nsuch as war, which would force the world to look elsewhere for its\\nsupply, and thus unnaturally force production elsewhere, the growth of\\nthis competition will probably be slow. Another War of 1812, or any\\nlong-continued civil convulsions, would force England to look to other\\nsources of supply, and, thus forcing production, would probably be the\\ndeath-blow of the monopoly. Apart from all disturbing influences arising\\nfrom the rashness of his own lieges, or other causes, the reign of King\\nCotton at present prices may be expected to continue some ten years\\nlonger. For so long, then, this disturbing influence may be looked for\\nin American politics; and then we may hope that this tremendous material\\ninfluence, become subject, like others, to the laws of trade and\\ncompetition, will cease to threaten our liberties by silently sapping\\ntheir very foundation. As in the course of years competition gradually\\nincreases, the effect of this competition on the South will probably be\\nmost beneficial. The change from monopoly to competition, distributed\\nover many years, will come with no sudden and destructive shock, but\\nwill take place imperceptibly. The fall of the dynasty will be gradual;\\nand with the dynasty must fall its policy. Its fruits must be eradicated\\nby time. Under the healing influence of time, the South, still young and\\nenergetic, ceasing to think of one thing alone, will quickly turn its\\nattention to many. Education will be more sought for, as the policy\\nwhich resisted it, and made its diffusion impossible, ceases to exist.\\nWith the growth of other branches of industry, labor will become\\nrespectable and profitable, and laborers will flock to the country; and\\na new, a purer, and more prosperous future will open upon the entire\\nRepublic. Perhaps, also, it may in time be discovered that even\\nslave-labor is most profitable when most intelligent and best\\nrewarded,--that the present mode of growing cotton is the most wasteful\\nand extravagant, and one not bearing competition. Thus even the African\\nmay reap benefit from the result, and in his increased self-respect and\\nintelligence may be found the real prosperity of the master. And thus\\nthe peaceful laws of trade may do the work which agitation has attempted\\nin vain. Sweet concord may come from this dark chaos, and the world\\nreceive another proof, that material interest, well understood, is\\nnot in conflict, but in beautiful unison with general morality,\\nall-pervading intelligence, and the precepts of Christianity. Under\\nthese influences, too, the very supply of cotton will probably be\\nimmensely increased. Its cultivation, like the cultivation of their\\nstaple products by the English counties mentioned by Smith, will\\nnot languish, but flourish, under the influence of healthy\\ncompetition.--These views, though simply the apparently legitimate\\nresult of principle and experience, are by no means unsupported by\\nauthority. They are the same results arrived at from the reflections of\\nthe most unprejudiced of observers. A shrewd Northern gentleman, who has\\nmore recently and thoroughly than any other writer travelled through the\\nSouthern States, in the final summary of his observations thus covers\\nall the positions here taken. \"My conclusion,\" says Mr. Olmsted, \"is\\nthis,--that there is no physical obstacle in the way of our country\\'s\\nsupplying ten bales of cotton where it now does one. All that is\\nnecessary for this purpose is to direct to the cotton-producing region\\nan adequate number of laborers, either black or white, or both. No\\namalgamation, no association on equality, no violent disruption of\\npresent relations is necessary. It is necessary that there should\\nbe more objects of industry, more varied enterprises, more general\\nintelligence among the people,--and, especially, that they should\\nbecome, or should desire to become, richer, more comfortable, than they\\nare.\"\\n\\nIt is not pleasant to turn from this, and view the reverse of the\\npicture. But, unless our Southern brethren, in obedience to some great\\nlaw of trade or morals, return from their divergence,--if, still being\\na republic in form, the South close her ears to the great truth, that\\neducation is democracy\\'s first law of self-preservation,--if the dynasty\\nof King Cotton, unshaken by present indications, should continue\\nindefinitely, and still the South should bow itself down as now before\\nits throne,--it requires no gift of prophecy to read her future. As you\\nsow, so shall you reap; and communities, like individuals, who sow the\\nwind, must, in the fulness of time, look to reap the whirlwind. The\\nConstitution of our Federal Union guaranties to each member composing it\\na republican form of government; but no constitution can guaranty that\\nuniversal intelligence of the people without which, soon or late, a\\nrepublican government must become, not only a form, but a mockery. Under\\nthe Cotton dynasty, the South has undoubtedly lost sight of this great\\nprinciple; and unless she return and bind herself closely to it, her\\nfate is fixed. Under the present monopolizing sway of King Cotton,--soon\\nor late, in the Union, or out of the Union,--her government must\\ncease to be republican, and relapse into anarchy, unless previously,\\nabandoning the experiment of democracy in despair, she take refuge in a\\ngovernment of force. The Northern States, the educational communities,\\nhave apparently little to fear while they cling closely to the\\nprinciples inherent in their nature. With the Servile States, or away\\nfrom them, the experiment of a constitutional republic can apparently be\\ncarried on with success through an indefinite lapse of time; but\\nthough, with the assistance of an original impetus and custom, they\\nmay temporarily drag along their stumbling brethren of the South, the\\ncatastrophe is but deferred, not avoided. Out of the Union, the more\\nextreme Southern States--those in which King Cotton has already firmly\\nestablished his dynasty--are, if we may judge by passing events, ripe\\nfor the result. The more Northern have yet a reprieve of fate, as having\\nnot yet wholly forgotten the lessons of their origin. The result,\\nhowever, be it delayed for one year or for one hundred years, can hardly\\nadmit of doubt. The emergency which is to try their system may not arise\\nfor many years; but passing events warn us that it maybe upon them now.\\nThe most philosophical of modern French historians, in describing the\\nlatter days of the Roman Empire, tells us that \"the higher classes of\\na nation can communicate virtue and wisdom to the government, if they\\nthemselves are virtuous and wise: but they can never give it strength;\\nfor strength always comes from below; it always proceeds from the\\nmasses.\" The Cotton dynasty pretends not only to maintain a government\\nwhere the masses are slaves, but a republican government where the vast\\nmajority of the higher classes are ignorant. On the intelligence of the\\nmass of the whites the South must rely for its republican permanence, as\\non their arms it must rely for its force; and here again, the words of\\nSismondi, written of falling Rome, seem already applicable to the South:\\n--\"Thus all that class of free cultivators, who more than any other\\nclass feel the love of country, who could defend the soil, and who ought\\nto furnish the best soldiers, disappeared almost entirely. The number\\nof small farmers diminished to such a degree, that a rich man, a man of\\nnoble family, had often to travel more than ten leagues before falling\\nin with an equal or a neighbor.\" The destruction of the republican form\\nof government is, then, almost the necessary catastrophe; but what will\\nfollow that catastrophe it is not so easy to foretell. The Republic,\\nthus undermined, will fall; but what shall supply its place? The\\ntendency of decaying republics is to anarchy; and men take refuge from\\nthe terrors of anarchy in despotism. The South least of all can indulge\\nin anarchy, as it would at once tend to servile insurrection. They\\ncannot long be torn by civil war, for the same reason. The ever-present,\\nall-pervading fear of the African must force them into some government,\\nand the stronger the better. The social divisions of the South, into the\\nrich and educated whites, the poor and ignorant whites, and the\\nservile class, would seem naturally to point to an aristocratic or\\nconstitutional-monarchical form of government. But, in their transition\\nstate, difficulties are to be met in all directions; and the\\nwell-ordered social distinctions of a constitutional monarchy seem\\nhardly consistent with the time-honored licentious independence and\\nrude equality of Southern society. The reign of King Cotton, however,\\nconducted under the present policy, must inevitably tend to increase and\\naggravate all the present social tendencies of the Southern system,--\\nall the anti-republican affinities already strongly developed. It makes\\ndeeper the chasm dividing the rich and the poor; it increases vastly the\\nranks of the uneducated; and, finally, while most unnaturally forcing\\nthe increase of the already threatening African infusion, it also tends\\nto make the servile condition more unendurable, and its burdens heavier.\\n\\nThe modern Southern politician is the least far-seeing of all our\\nshort-sighted classes of American statesmen. In the existence of a\\nnation, a generation should be considered but as a year in the life of\\nman, and a century but as a generation of citizens. Soon or late, in the\\nlives of this generation or of their descendants, in the Union or out\\nof the Union, the servile members of this Confederacy must, under the\\nresults of the prolonged dynasty of Cotton, make their election either\\nto purchase their security, like Cuba, by dependence on the strong arm\\nof external force, or they must meet national exigencies, pass through\\nrevolutions, and destroy and reconstruct governments, making every\\nmovement on the surface of a seething, heaving volcano. All movements of\\nthe present, looking only to the forms of government of the master, must\\nbe carried on before the face of the slave, and the question of class\\nwill ever be complicated by that of caste. What the result of the\\never-increasing tendencies of the Cotton dynasty will be it is therefore\\nimpossible to more than dream. But is it fair to presume that the\\nimmense servile population should thus see upturnings and revolutions,\\ndynasties rising and falling before their eyes, and ever remain quiet\\nand contented? \"Nothing,\" said Jefferson, \"is more surely written in the\\nBook of Fate than that this people must be free.\" Fit for freedom at\\npresent they are not, and, under the existing policy of the Cotton\\ndynasty, never can be. \"Whether under any circumstances they could\\nbecome so is not here a subject of discussion; but, surely, the day will\\ncome when the white caste will wish the experiment had been tried. The\\nargument of the Cotton King against the alleviation of the condition of\\nthe African is, that his nature does not admit of his enjoyment of true\\nfreedom consistently with the security of the community, and therefore\\nhe must have none. But certainly his school has been of the worst. Would\\nnot, perhaps, the reflections applied to the case of the French peasants\\nof a century ago apply also to them?\" It is not under oppression that\\nwe learn how to use freedom. The ordinary sophism by which misrule is\\ndefended is, when truly stilted, this: The people must continue in\\nslavery, because slavery has generated in them all the vices of slaves;\\nbecause they are ignorant, they must remain under a power which has made\\nand which keeps them ignorant; because they have been made ferocious by\\nmisgovernment, they must be misgoverned forever. If the system under\\nwhich they live were so mild and liberal that under its operation they\\nhad become humane and enlightened, it would be safe to venture on a\\nchange; but, as this system has destroyed morality, and prevented the\\ndevelopment of the intellect,--as it has turned men, who might, under\\ndifferent training, have formed a virtuous and happy community, into\\nsavage and stupid wild beasts, therefore it ought to last forever.\\nPerhaps the counsellors of King Cotton think that in this case it will;\\nbut all history teaches us another lesson. If there be one spark of love\\nfor freedom in the nature of the African,--whether it be a love common\\nto him with the man or the beast, the Caucasian or the chimpanzee,--the\\nlove of freedom as affording a means of improvement or an opportunity\\nfor sloth,--the policy of King Cotton will cause it to work its way out.\\nIt is impossible to say how long it will be in so doing, or what weight\\nthe broad back of the African will first be made to bear; but, if the\\nspirit exist, some day it must out. This lesson is taught us by the\\nwhole recorded history of the world. Moses leading the Children of\\nIsrael up out of Egypt,--Spartacus at the gates of Rome,--the Jacquerie\\nin France,--Jack Cade and Wat Tyler in England,--Nana Sahib and the\\nSepoys in India,--Toussaint l\\'Ouverture and the Haytiens,--and, finally,\\nthe insurrection of Nat Turner in this country, with those in Guiana,\\nJamaica, and St. Lucia: such examples, running through all history,\\npoint the same moral. This last result of the Cotton dynasty may come at\\nany moment after the time shall once have arrived when, throughout any\\ngreat tract of country, the suppressing force shall temporarily, with\\nall the advantages of mastership, including intelligence and weapons, be\\nunequal to coping with the force suppressed. That time may still be far\\noff. Whether it be or not depends upon questions of government and\\nthe events of the chapter of accidents. If the Union should now be\\ndissolved, and civil convulsions should follow, it may soon be upon us.\\nBut the superimposed force is yet too great under any circumstances, and\\nthe convulsion would probably be but temporary. At present, too, the\\nvalue of the slave insures him tolerable treatment; but, as numbers\\nincrease, this value must diminish. Southern statesmen now assert that\\nin thirty years there will be twelve million slaves in the South; and\\nthen, with increased numbers, why should not the philosophy of the\\nsugar-plantation prevail, and it become part of the economy of the\\nCotton creed, that it is cheaper to work slaves to death and purchase\\nfresh ones than to preserve their usefulness by moderate employment?\\nThen the value of the slave will no longer protect him, and then the\\nend will be nigh. Is this thirty or fifty years off? Perhaps not for\\na century hence will the policy of King Cotton work its legitimate\\nresults, and the volcano at length come to its head and defy all\\ncompression.\\n\\nIn one of the stories of the \"Arabian Nights\" we are told of an Afrite\\nconfined by King Solomon in a brazen vessel; and the Sultana tells\\nus, that, during the first century of his confinement, he said in his\\nheart,--\"I will enrich whosoever will liberate me\"; but no one liberated\\nhim. In the second century he said,--\"Whosoever will liberate me, I will\\nopen to him the treasures of the earth\"; but no one liberated him. And\\nfour centuries more passed, and he said,--\"Whosoever shall liberate me,\\nI will fulfil for him three wishes\"; but still no one liberated him.\\nThen despair at his long bondage took possession of his soul, and, in\\nthe eighth century, he swore,--\"Whosoever shall liberate me, him will\\nI surely slay!\" Let the Southern statesmen look to it well that the\\nbreaking of the seal which confines our Afrite be not deferred till long\\nbondage has turned his heart, like the heart of the Spirit in the fable,\\ninto gall and wormwood; lest, if the breaking of that seal be deferred\\nto the eighth or even the sixth century, it result to our descendants\\nlike the breaking of the sixth seal of Revelation,--\"And, lo! there was\\na great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and\\nthe moon became as blood, and the heaven departed as a scroll, when it\\nis rolled together; and the kings of the earth, and the great men, and\\nthe rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every free\\nman hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains, and\\nsaid to the mountains and rocks, \\'Fall on us and hide us, for the great\\nday of wrath is come\\'\" On that day, at least, will end the reign of King\\nCotton.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nGLIMPSES OF GARIBALDI.\\n\\n\\nFIRST GLIMPSE.\\n\\n\\nIt is a sultry morning in October, and we are steaming in a small\\nSardinian boat from Leghorn towards Naples. This city has fallen into\\nthe power of Garibaldi, who is concentrating his forces before Capua,\\nwhile the King of Sardinia bears down with a goodly army from the North.\\n\\nThe first object of special interest which comes into view, after we\\npass the island of Elba, is Gaeta. Though care is taken not to run near\\nenough to invite a chase from the Neapolitan frigates, we are yet able\\nto obtain a distinct view of the last stronghold--the jumping-off place,\\nas we hope it will prove--of Francis II. The white walls of the fortress\\nrise grimly out of the sea, touching the land only upon one side, and\\nlooking as though they might task well the resources of modern warfare\\nto reduce them. We soon make out the smoke of four or five steamers,\\nwhich we suppose to be armed vessels, heading towards Gaeta.\\n\\nAbout two o\\'clock we glide into the far-famed Bay of Naples, in company\\nwith the cool sea-breeze which there each afternoon sends to refresh\\nthe heated shore. As we swing round to our moorings, we pass numerous\\nline-of-battle-ships and frigates bearing the flags of England,\\nFrance, and Sardinia, but look in vain and with disappointment for the\\nstar-spangled banner. A single floating representative of American\\nnationality is obliged to divide the favor of her presence between the\\nports of both the Two Sicilies, and at this time she is at the island\\nportion of the kingdom.\\n\\nOur craft is at once beset by boats, their owners pushing, vociferating,\\nand chaffering for fares, as though Mammon, and not Moloch, were the\\nruling spirit. Together with a chance companion of the voyage, Signor\\nAlvigini, _Intendente_ of Genoa, and his party, we are soon in the hands\\nof the _commissionnaire_ of the Hotel de Rome. As we land, our passports\\nare received by the police of Victor Emmanuel, who have replaced those\\nof the late _regime_.\\n\\nAs we enter our carriage, we expect to see streets filled with crowds of\\nturbulent people, or dotted with knots of persons conversing ominously\\nin suppressed tones; and streets deserted, with shops closed; and\\nstreets barricaded. But in this matter we are agreeably disappointed.\\nThe shops are all open, the street venders are quietly tending their\\ntables, people go about their ordinary affairs, and wear their\\ncommonplace, every-day look. The only difference apparent to the eye\\nbetween the existing state of things and that which formerly obtained\\nis, that there are few street brawls and robberies, though every one\\ngoes armed,--that the uniform of the soldiers of Francis II. is replaced\\nby the dark gray dress of the National Guard,--and that the Hag of\\nthe Tyrant King no longer waves over the castle-prison of Sant\\' Elmo.\\nGaribaldi, on leaving Naples, had formally confided the city to the\\nNational Guard; and they had nobly sustained the trust reposed in them.\\n\\nA letter of introduction to General Orsini, brought safely with us,\\nthough not without adventure, through the Austrian dominions, gains\\na courteous reception from General Turr, chief aide-de-camp to the\\n\"Dictator,\" and a pass to the camp. General Turr, an Hungarian refugee,\\nis a person of distinguished appearance, not a little heightened by\\nhis peculiar dress, which consists of the usual Garibaldian uniform\\npartially covered with a white military cloak, which hangs gracefully\\nover his elegant figure.\\n\\nAfter a brief, but pleasant, interview with this gentleman, we climb to\\nthe Castle of Sant\\' Elmo, built on a high eminence commanding the town,\\nand with its guns mounted, not so as to defend it against an invading\\nenemy, but to hurl destruction on the devoted subjects of the Bourbon.\\nWe are told that the people Lad set their hearts on seeing this\\nfortress, which they look upon as a standing menace, razed to the\\nground, and its site covered with peaceful dwellings. And it is not\\nwithout regret that we have since learned that Victor Emmanuel has\\nthought it inexpedient to comply with this wish. Nor, in our ignorance,\\ncan we divest ourselves entirely of the belief that it would have been a\\nwise as well as conciliatory policy to do so.\\n\\nWe are politely shown over the castle by one of the National Guard, who\\nhold it in charge, and see lounging upon one of its terraces, carefully\\nguarded, but kindly allowed all practicable liberty, several officers of\\nthe late power, prisoners where they had formerly held despotic sway. We\\ndescend into the now empty dungeons, dark and noisome as they have been\\ndescribed, where victims of political accusation or suspicion have pined\\nfor years in dreary solitude. It produces a marked sensation in the\\nminds of our Italian companions in this sad tour of inspection, when\\nwe tell them, through our guide Antonio, that these cells are the\\ncounterpart of the dungeons of the condemned in the prison of the Doges\\nof Venice, as we had seen them a few days before,--save that the latter\\nwere better, in their day, in so far as in them the cold stone was\\noriginally lined and concealed by wooden casings, while in those before\\nus the helpless prisoner in his gropings could touch only the hard rock,\\nsignificant of the relentless despotism which enchained him. The walls\\nare covered with the inscriptions of former tenants. In One place we\\ndiscover a long line of marks in groups of fives,--like the tallies of\\nour boyish sports,--but here used for how different a purpose! Were\\nthese the records of days, or weeks, or months? The only furniture of\\nthe cells is a raised platform of wood, the sole bed of the miserable\\ninmate. The Italian visitors, before leaving, childishly vent their\\nuseless rage at the sight of these places of confinement, by breaking to\\npieces the windows and shutters, and scattering their fragments on the\\nfloor.\\n\\nWe have returned from Sant\\' Elmo, and, evening having arrived, are\\nsitting in the smoking-room of the Hotel de Grande Bretagne, conversing\\nwith one of the English Volunteers, when our friend General J--n of the\\nBritish Army, one of the lookers-on in Naples, comes in, having just\\nreturned from \"the front.\" He brings the news of a smart skirmish which\\nhas taken place during the day; of the English \"Excursionists\" being\\nordered out in advance; of their rushing with alacrity into the thickest\\nof the fight, and bravely sustaining the conflict,--being, indeed,\\nwith difficulty withheld by their officers from needlessly exposing\\nthemselves. But this inspiring news is tinged with sadness. One of their\\nnumber, well known and much beloved, had fallen, killed instantly by a\\nbullet through the head. Military ardor, aroused by the report of\\nbrave deeds, is for a few moments held in abeyance by grief, and\\nthen rekindled by the desire of vengeance. Hot blood is up, and the\\nprevailing feeling is a longing for a renewal of the fight. We are told,\\nif we wish to see an action, to go to \"the front\" to-morrow. Accordingly\\nwe decide to be there.\\n\\nThe following day, our faithful _commissionnaire_, Antonio, places us\\nin a carriage drawn by a powerful pair of horses, and headed for the\\nGaribaldian camp. A hamper of provisions is not forgotten, and before\\nstarting we cause Antonio to double the supplies: we have a presentiment\\nthat we may find with whom to share them.\\n\\nThere are twelve miles before us to the nearest point in the camp, which\\nis Caserta. Our chief object being to see the hero of Italy, if we do\\nnot find him at Caserta, we shall push on four miles farther, to Santa\\nMaria; and, missing him there, ride still another four miles to Sant\\'\\nAngelo, where rests the extreme right of the army over against Capua.\\n\\nAs we ride over the broad and level road from Naples to Caserta,\\nbordered with lines of trees through its entire length, we are surprised\\nto see not only husbandmen quietly tilling the fields, but laborers\\nengaged in public works upon the highway, as if in the employ of a long\\nestablished authority, and making it difficult to believe that we are\\nin the midst of civil war, and under a provisional government of a few\\nweeks\\' standing. But this and kindred wonders are fruits of the spell\\nwrought by Garibaldi, who wove the most discordant elements into\\nharmony, and made hostile factions work together for the common good,\\nfor the sake of the love they bore to him.\\n\\nAbout mid-day we arrive at a redoubt which covers a part of the road,\\nleaving barely enough space for one vehicle to pass. We are of course\\nstopped, but are courteously received by the officer of the guard.\\nWe show our pass from General Turr, giving us permission \"freely to\\ntraverse all parts of the camp,\" and being told to drive on, find\\nourselves within the lines. As we proceed, we see laborers busily\\nengaged throwing up breastworks, soldiers reposing beneath the trees,\\nand on every side the paraphernalia of war.\\n\\nGaribaldi is not here, nor do we find him at Santa Maria. So we prolong\\nour ride to the twentieth mile by driving our reeking, but still\\nvigorous horses to Sant\\' Angelo.\\n\\nWe are now in sight of Capua, where Francis II. is shut up with a strong\\ngarrison. The place is a compact walled town, crowned by the dome of a\\nlarge and handsome church, and situated in a plain by the side of the\\nVolturno. Though, contrary to expectation, there is no firing to-day, we\\nsee all about us the havoc of previous cannonadings. The houses we pass\\nare riddled with round shot thrown by the besieged, and the ground is\\nstrewn with the limbs of trees severed by iron missiles. But where is\\nGaribaldi? No one knows. Yonder, however, is a lofty hill, and upon its\\nsummit we descry three or four persons. It is there, we are told, that\\nthe Commander-in-Chief goes to observe the enemy, and among the forms we\\nsee is very probably the one we seek.\\n\\nWe have just got into our carriage again, and are debating as to whither\\nwe shall go next, when we are addressed from the road-side in English.\\nThere, dressed in the red shirt, are three young men, all not far from\\ntwenty years of age, members of the British regiment of \"Excursionists.\"\\nThey are out foraging for their mess, and ask a ride with us to Santa\\nMaria. We are only too glad of their company; and off we start, a\\ncarriage-full. Then commences a running fire of question and response.\\nWe find the society of our companions a valuable acquisition. They are\\nfrom London,--young men of education, and full of enthusiasm for\\nthe cause of Italian liberty. One of them is a connection of our\\ndistinguished countrywoman, Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe. Before going to\\nSanta Maria, they insist on doing the honors, and showing the objects\\nof interest the vicinity. So they take us to their barrack, a large\\nfarm-house, and thence to \"the front.\" To the latter spot our coachman\\ndeclines driving, as his horses are not bullet-proof, and the enemy is\\nnot warranted to abstain from firing during our visit. So, proceeding on\\nfoot, we reach a low breastwork of sand-bags, with an orchard in advance\\nof it. Here, our companions tell us, was the scene of yesterday\\'s\\nskirmish, in which they took an active part. The enemy had thrown out a\\ndetachment of sharp-shooters, who had entered the wood, and approached\\nthe breastwork. A battalion of the English Volunteers was ordered up. As\\nthey marched eagerly forwards, a body of Piedmontese, stationed a little\\nfrom the road, shouted, \"_Vivano gl\\' Inglesi! Vivano gl\\' Inglesi!_\"\\nAt the breastworks where we are standing, the word was given to break\\nranks, and skirmish. Instantly they sprang over the wall, and took\\nposition behind the trees, to shoot \"wherever they saw a head.\" Each\\nsoldier had his \"covering man,\"--a comrade stationed about ten feet\\nbehind him, whose duty it was to keep his own piece charged ready to\\nkill any of the enemy who might attempt to pick off the leading man\\nwhile the latter was loading. One of my young friends had the hammer of\\nhis rifle shot off in his hand. He kept his position till another weapon\\nwas passed out to him. The action lasted till evening, when the enemy\\ndrew off, there being various and uncertain reports as to their loss.\\nOur British cousins had some ten wounded, besides the one killed.\\nFighting royalists, we will mention here, was no fancy-work about that\\ntime, as the Neapolitans had an ugly trick of extinguishing the eyes of\\ntheir prisoners, and then putting their victims to death.\\n\\nWe return to our carriage, drive into a sheltered spot, and give the\\nword of command to Antonio to open the hamper and deploy his supplies,\\nwhen hungry soldiers vie with the ravenous traveller in a knife-and-fork\\nskirmish. No fault was found with the _cuisine_ of the Hotel de Grande\\nBretagne.\\n\\nThe rations disposed of, we set off again for Santa Maria. Arrived at\\nthe village, at the request of our companions, we visit with them a\\nhospital, to see one of their comrades, wounded in the action of the\\npreceding day, and, as we are known to profess the healing art, to give\\nour opinion as to his condition. We enter a large court-yard surrounded\\nwith farm-buildings, one wing of which is devoted to hospital purposes.\\nWe find the wards clean and well ventilated, and wearing the look of\\nbeing well attended. This favorable condition is owing in great measure\\nto the interposition and supervision of several ladies, among whom are\\nspecially mentioned the two daughters of an English clergyman, without\\nomitting the name of the Countess della Torres. The wounded comrade of\\nour friends had been struck by a ball, which had not been readied by the\\nprobe, and was supposed to have entered the lung. The poor young fellow\\ndraws his rapid breath with much pain, but is full of pluck, and meets\\nthe encouraging assurances of his friends with a smile and words of\\nfortitude. Some time afterwards we learn that he is convalescent, though\\nin a disabled state.\\n\\nIt now becomes necessary to say our mutual farewells, which we do as\\ncordially as though we had been old friends. We go our respective ways,\\nto meet once more in Italy, and to renew our acquaintance again in\\nLondon, where we subsequently spend a pleasant evening together by a\\ncheerful English fireside.\\n\\nScarcely have we parted with these new-found friends of kindred blood\\nand common language, when we are provided with another companion.\\nAn Italian officer asks a seat with us to Caserta. Our letter of\\nintroduction to General Orsini being shown to him, he volunteers to\\nassist us in attaining our object, that of seeing the hero of Italy.\\nAt five, we are before the palace of Caserta, now a barrack, and the\\nhead-quarters of the Commander-in-Chief. The building is one of great\\nsize and beauty of architecture. A lofty arch, sustained by elegant and\\nmassive marble pillars, bisects the structure, and on either side one\\nmay pass from the archway into open areas of spacious dimensions, from\\nwhich lead passages to the various offices. We approach a very splendid\\nmarble staircase leading to the state apartments. A sentinel forbids us\\nto pass. This is, then, perhaps, the part of the building occupied by\\nthe Commander-in-Chief. Not so. The state apartments are unoccupied, and\\nare kept sacred from intrusion, as the property of the nation to which\\nthey are to belong. Garibaldi\\'s apartments are among the humblest in the\\npalace. We go on to the end of the archway, and see, stretching as far\\nas the eye can reach, the Royal Drive, leading through a fine avenue of\\ntrees, and reminding us of the \"Long Walk\" at Windsor Castle. Retracing\\nour steps, and crossing one of the court-yards, we ascend a modest\\nstaircase, and are in the antechamber of the apartments of the\\nCommander-in-Chief. There are sentinels at the outer door, others at\\nthe first landing, and a guard of honor, armed with halberds, in the\\nantechamber. Our courteous companion, by virtue of his official rank,\\nhas passed us without difficulty by the sentries, and quits us to\\ndischarge the duty which brought him to Caserta.\\n\\nWe are now eagerly expectant of the arrival of him whose face we have so\\nlong sought The hour is at hand when he joins his military family at an\\nunostentatious and very frugal dinner. In about half an hour there is\\na sudden cessation in the hum of conversation, the guard is ordered to\\nstand to arms, and in a moment more, amid profound silence, Garibaldi\\nhas passed through the antechamber, leaving the place, as it were,\\npervaded by his presence. We had beheld an erect form, of rather low\\nstature, but broad and compact, a lofty brow, a composed and thoughtful\\nface, with decision and reserved force depicted on every line of it.\\nIn the mien and carriage we had seen realized all that we had read and\\nheard of the air of one born to command.\\n\\nOur hero wore the characteristic red shirt and gray trousers, and,\\nthrown over them, a short gray cloak faced with red. When without the\\ncloak, there might be seen, hanging upon the back, and fastened around\\nthe throat, the party- kerchief usually appertaining to priestly\\nvestments.\\n\\nReturning to Naples, and sitting that night at our window, with the most\\nbeautiful of bays before us, we treasure up for perpetual recollection\\nthe picture of Garibaldi at head-quarters.\\n\\n\\nGARIBALDI AT POMPEII.\\n\\n\\nIt is Sunday, the 21st of October. We have to-day observed the people,\\nin the worst quarters of the city as well as in the best, casting their\\nballots in an orderly and quiet manner, under the supervision of the\\nNational Guard, for Victor Emmanuel as their ruler. To-morrow we have\\nset apart for exploring Pompeii, little dreaming what awaits us there.\\nOur friend, General J--n, of the British Army, learning that there is no\\nlikelihood of active operations at \"the front,\" proposes to join us in\\nour excursion.\\n\\nWe are seated in the restaurant at the foot of the acclivity which\\nleads to the exhumed city, when suddenly Antonio appears and exclaims,\\n\"Garibaldi!\" We look in the direction he indicates, and, in an avenue\\nleading from the railway, we behold the Patriot-Soldier of Italy\\nadvancing toward us, accompanied by the Countess Pallavicini, the wife\\nof the Prodictator of Naples, and attended by General Turr, with several\\nothers of his staff. We go out to meet them. General J--n, a warm\\nadmirer of Garibaldi, gives him a cordial greeting, and presents us as\\nan American. We say a few words expressive of the sympathy entertained\\nby the American people for the cause of Italy and its apostle. He whom\\nwe thus address, in his reply, professes his happiness in enjoying the\\ngood wishes of Americans, and, gracefully turning to our friend, adds,\\n\"I am grateful also for the sympathy of the English.\" The party then\\npass on, and we are left with the glowing thought that we have grasped\\nthe hand of Garibaldi.\\n\\nHalf an hour later, we are absorbed in examining one of the structures\\nof what was once Pompeii, when suddenly we hear martial music. We follow\\nthe direction of the sound, and presently find ourselves in the ancient\\nforum. In the centre of the inclosure is a military band playing the\\n\"Hymn of Garibaldi\"; while at its northern extremity, standing, facing\\nus, between the columns of the temple of Jupiter, with full effect given\\nto the majesty of his bearing, is Garibaldi. Moved by the strikingly\\ncontrasting associations of the time and the place, we turn to General\\nJ--n, saying, \"Behold around us the symbols of the death of Italy, and\\nthere the harbinger of its resurrection.\" Our companion, fired with a\\nlike enthusiasm, immediately advances to the base of the temple, and,\\nremoving his hat, repeats the words in the presence of those there\\nassembled.\\n\\n\\nGARIBALDI AT \"THE FRONT.\"\\n\\n\\nOnce again we look in the eye of this wonderful man, and take him by the\\nhand. This time it is at \"the front.\" On Saturday, the 27th of October,\\nwe are preparing to leave Naples for Rome by the afternoon boat, when we\\nreceive a message from General J--n that the bombardment of Capua is to\\nbegin on the following day at ten o\\'clock, and inviting us to join his\\nparty to the camp. Accordingly, postponing our departure for the North,\\nwe get together a few surgical instruments, and take a military train\\nupon the railway in the afternoon for the field of action.\\n\\nOur party consists of General J--n, General W., of Virginia, Captain\\nG., a Scotch officer serving in Italy, and ourself. Arrived at Caserta,\\nCaptain G., showing military despatches, is provided with a carriage, in\\nwhich we all drive to the advanced post at Sant\\' Angelo. We reach this\\nplace at about eight o\\'clock, when we ride and walk through the camp,\\nwhich presents a most picturesque aspect, illuminated as it is by a\\nbrilliant moon. We see clusters of white tents, with now and then the\\ngeneral silence broken by the sound of singing wafted to us from among\\nthem,--here and there tired soldiers lying asleep on the ground, covered\\nwith their cloaks,--horses picketed in the fields,--camp-fires burning\\nbrightly in various directions; while all seems to indicate the profound\\nrepose of men preparing for serious work on the morrow. We pass and\\nrepass a bridge, a short time before thrown across the Volturno. A\\nportion of the structure has broken down; but our English friends\\ncongratulate themselves that the part built by their compatriots has\\nstood firm. We exchange greetings with Colonel Bourdonne, who is on duty\\nhere for the night, superintending the repairs of the bridge, and who\\nkindly consigns us to his quarters.\\n\\nArrived at the farm-house where Colonel Bourdonne has established\\nhimself, and using his name, we are received with the utmost attention\\nby the servants. The only room at their disposal, fortunately a large\\none, they soon arrange for our accommodation. To General J---n, the\\nsenior of the party, is assigned the only bed; an Italian officer\\noccupies a sofa; while General W., Captain G., and ourself are ranged,\\n\"all in a row,\" on bags of straw placed upon the floor. Of the\\nmerriment, prolonged far into the night, and making the house resound\\nwith peals of laughter,--not at all to the benefit, we fear, of several\\nwounded officers in a neighboring room,--we may not write.\\n\\nSunday is a warm, clear, summer-like day, and our party climb the\\nprincipal eminence of Sant\\' Angelo to witness the expected bombardment.\\nWe reach the summit at ten minutes before ten, the hour announced for\\nopening fire. We find several officers assembled there,--among them\\nGeneral H., of Virginia. Low tone of conversation and a restrained\\ndemeanor are impressed on all; for, a few paces off, conferring with\\ntwo or three confidential aids, is the man whose very presence is\\ndignity,--Garibaldi.\\n\\nCasting our eye over the field, we cannot realize that there are such\\nhosts of men under arms about us, till a military guide by our side\\npoints out their distribution to us.\\n\\n\"Look there!\" says General H., pointing to an orchard beneath. \"Under\\nthose trees they are swarming thick as bees. There are ten thousand men,\\nat least, in that spot alone.\"\\n\\nWith an opera-glass we can distinctly scan the walls of Capua, and\\nobserve that they are not yet manned. But the besieged are throwing out\\ntroops by thousands into the field before our lines. We remark one large\\nbody drawn up in the shelter of the shadow cast by a large building.\\nEvery now and then, from out this shadow, a piercing ray of light is\\nshot, reflected from the helm or sword-case of the commanding officer,\\nwho is gallantly riding up and down before his men, and probably\\nharanguing them in preparation for the expected conflict. All these\\nthings strike the attention with a force and meaning far different from\\nthe impression produced by the holiday pageantry of mimic war.\\n\\nThe Commander-in-Chief is now disengaged, and our party approach him\\nto pay their respects. By the advice of General J---n, we proffer our\\nmedical services for the day; and we receive a pressure of the hand, a\\ngenial look, and a bind acknowledgment of the offer. But we are told\\nthere will be no general action to-day. Our report of these words, as\\nwe rejoin our companions, is the first intimation given that the\\nbombardment is deferred. But, though, there is some disappointment,\\ntheir surprise is not extreme. For Garibaldi never informs even his\\nnearest aide-de-camp what he is about to do. In fact, he quaintly says,\\n\"If his shirt knew his plans, he would take it off and burn it.\" Some\\nhalf-hour later, having descended from the eminence, we take our last\\nlook of Garibaldi. He has retired with a single servant to a sequestered\\nplace upon the mount, whither he daily resorts, and where his mid-day\\nrepast is brought to him. Here he spends an hour or two secure from\\ninterruption. What thoughts he ponders in his solitude the reader may\\nperhaps conjecture as well as his most intimate friend. But for us, with\\nthe holy associations of a very high mountain before our mind, we can\\nbut trust that a prayer, \"uttered or unexpressed,\" invokes the divine\\nblessing upon the work to which Garibaldi devotes himself,--the\\npolitical salvation of his country.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nTWO OR THREE TROUBLES.\\n\\n[Concluded.]\\n\\n\\nEvery day, and twice a day, came Mr. Sampson,--though I have not said\\nmuch about it; and now it was only a week before our marriage. This\\nevening he came in very weary with his day\\'s work,--getting a wretched\\nman off from hanging, who probably deserved it richly. (It is said,\\nwomen are always for hanging: and that is very likely. I remember, when\\nthere had been a terrible murder in our parlors, as it were, and it was\\ndoubtful for some time whether the murderer would be convicted, Mrs.\\nHarris said, plaintively, \"Oh, do hang somebody!\") Mr. Sampson did\\nnot think so, apparently, but sat on the sofa by the window, dull and\\nabstracted.\\n\\nIf I had been his wife, I should have done as I always do now in such a\\ncase: walked up to him, settled the sofa-cushion, and said,--\"Here, now!\\nlie down, and don\\'t speak a word for two hours. Meantime I will tell you\\nwho has been here, and everything.\" Thus I should rest and divert him by\\nidle chatter, bathing his tired brain with good Cologne; and if, in the\\nmiddle of my best story and funniest joke, he fairly dropped off to\\nsleep, I should just fan him softly, keep the flies away, say in my\\nheart, \"Bless him! there he goes! hands couldn\\'t mend him!\"--and then\\nlook at him with as much more pride and satisfaction than, at any other\\ncommon wide-awake face as it is possible to conceive.\\n\\nHowever, not being married, and having a whole week more to be silly\\nin, I was both silly and suspicious. This was partly his fault. He was\\nreserved, naturally and habitually; and as he didn\\'t tell me he was\\ntired and soul-weary, I never thought of that. Instead, as he sat on the\\nsofa, I took a long string of knitting-work and seated myself across the\\nroom,--partly so that he might come to me, where there was a good seat.\\nThen, as he did not cross the room, but still sat quietly on the sofa,\\nI began to wonder and suspect. Did he work too hard? Did he dread\\nundertaking matrimony? Did he wish he could get off? Why did he not come\\nand speak to me? What had I done? Nothing! Nothing!\\n\\nHere Laura came in to say she was going to Mrs. Harris\\'s to get the\\nnewest news about sleeves. Mrs. Harris for sleeves; Mrs. Gore for\\nbonnets; and for housekeeping, recipes, and all that, who but Mrs.\\nParker, who knew that, and a hundred other things? Many-sided are we\\nall: talking sentiment with this one, housekeeping with that, and to a\\nthird saying what wild horses would not tear from us to the two first!\\n\\nLaura went. And presently he said, wearily, but _I_ thought drearily,--\\n\\n\"Delphine, are you all ready to be married?\"\\n\\nThe blood flushed from my heart to my forehead and back again. So, then,\\nhe thought I was ready and waiting to drop like a ripe plum into his\\nmouth, without his asking me! Am I ready, indeed? And suppose I am\\nnot? Perhaps I, too, may have my misgivings. A woman\\'s place is not a\\nsinecure. Troubles, annoyances, as the sparks fly upward! Buttons to\\nbegin with, and everything to end with! What did Mrs. Hemans say, poor\\nwoman?\\n\\n  \"Her lot is on you! silent tears to weep,\\n  And patient smiles to wear through suffering\\'s hour,\\n  And sumless riches from affection\\'s deep\\n  To pour on\"--something--\"a wasted shower!\"\\n\\nYes, wasted, indeed! I hadn\\'t answered a word to his question.\\n\\n\"It seems warm in this room,\" said he again, languidly; \"shall we walk\\non the piazza?\"\\n\\n\"I think not,\" I answered, curtly; \"I am not warm.\"\\n\\nEven that, did not bring him to me. He still leaned his head on his hand\\nfor a minute or two, and then rose from the sofa and sat by the window,\\nlooking at the western sky, where the sun had long gone down. I could\\nsee his profile against the outer light, however, and it did not look\\nplacid. His brow was knit and mouth compressed. So, then, it was all\\nvery likely!\\n\\nHaving set out on my race of suspecting, my steeds did not lag. They\\nwere winged already, and I goaded them continually with memories. There\\nwas nothing I did not think of or accuse him of,--especially, the last\\nand worst sin of breaking off our engagement at the eleventh hour!--and\\nI, who had suffered silently, secretly, untold torments about that name\\nof his,--nobody, no man, could ever guess how keenly, because no man can\\never feel as a woman does about such things! Men,--they would as soon\\nmarry Tabitha as Juliana. They could call her \"Wife.\" It made no matter\\nto them. What did any man care, provided she chronicled small beer,\\nwhether she had taste, feeling, sentiment, anything? Here I was wrong,\\nas most passionate people are at some time in their lives. Some men do\\ncare.\\n\\nAt the moment I had reached the top-most pinnacle of my wrath, and was\\ndarting lightnings on all mankind, Polly showed in Lieutenant Herbert,\\nwith his book of promised engravings.\\n\\nWith a natural revulsion of temper, I descended rapidly from my\\npinnacle, and, stepping half-way across the room, met the Lieutenant\\nwith unusual cordiality. Mr. Sampson bowed slightly and sat still. I\\ndrew two chairs towards the centre-table, lighted the argand, and seated\\nmyself with the young officer to examine and admire the beautiful\\nforms in which the gifted artist has clothed the words rather than the\\nthoughts of the writer,--out of the coarse real, lifting the scenes into\\nthe sweet ideal,--and out of the commonest, rudest New-England life,\\nbringing the purest and most charming idyllic song. We did not say this.\\n\\nI looked across at the window, where still sat the figure, motionless.\\nNot a word from him. I looked at Lieutenant Herbert. He was really very\\nhandsome, with an imperial brow, and roseate lips like a girl\\'s. Somehow\\nhe made me think of Claverhouse,--so feminine in feature, so martial in\\naction! Then he talked,--talked really quite well,--reflected my own\\nideas in an animated and eloquent manner.\\n\\nWhy it was,--whether Herbert suspected we had had a lovers\\' quarrel,--or\\nwhether his vanity was flattered at my attention to him, which was\\nentirely unusual,--or whether my own excited, nervous condition led me\\nto express the most joyous life and good-humor, and shut down all my\\nangry sorrow and indignant suspicions, while I smiled and danced over\\ntheir sepulchre,--however it was, I know not,--but a new sparkle\\ncame into the blue eyes of the young militaire. He was positively\\nentertaining. Conscious that he was talking well, he talked better. He\\nrecited poetry; he was even witty, or seemed so. With the magnetism of\\ncordial sympathy, I called out from his memory treasures new and old. He\\nbecame not only animated, but devoted.\\n\\nAll this time the figure at the window sat calm and composed. It was\\nintensely, madly provoking. He was so very sure of me, it appeared, he\\nwould not take the trouble to enter the lists to shiver a lance with\\nthis elegant young man with the beautiful name, the beautiful lips, and\\nwith, for the last half-hour at least, the beautiful tongue. He would\\nnot trouble himself to entertain his future wife. He would not trouble\\nhimself even to speak. Very well! Very well indeed! Did the Lieutenant\\nlike music? If \"he\" did not care a jot for me, perhaps others did. My\\nheart beat very fast now; my cheeks burned, and my lips were parched. A\\nglass of water restored me to calmness, and I sat at the piano. Herbert\\nturned over the music, while I rattled off whatever came to my fingers\\'\\nends,--I did not mind or know what. It was very fine, I dare say. He\\nwhispered that it was \"so beautiful!\"--and I answered nothing, but kept\\non playing, playing, playing, as the little girl in the Danish story\\nkeeps on dancing, dancing, dancing, with the fairy red shoes on. Should\\nI play on forever? In the church,--out of it,--up the street,--down the\\nstreet,--out in the fields,--under the trees,--by the wood,--by the\\nwater,--in cathedrals,--I heard something murmuring,--something softly,\\nsoftly in my ear. Still I played on and on, and still something murmured\\nsoftly, softly in my ear. I looked at the window. The head was leaned\\ndown, and resting on both arms. Fast asleep, probably. Then I played\\nlouder, and faster, and wilder.\\n\\nThen, for the first time, as deaf persons are said to hear well in\\nthe noise of a crowded street, or in a rail-car, so did I hear in the\\nmusical tumult, for the first time, the words of Herbert. They had been\\nwhispered, and I had heard, but not perceived them, till this moment.\\n\\nI turned towards him, looked him full in the face, and dropped both\\nhands into my lap. Well might I be astonished! He started and blushed\\nviolently, but said nothing. As for me, I was never more calm in my\\nlife. In the face of a real mistake, all imaginary ones fell to the\\nground, motionless as so many men of straw. With an instinct that went\\nbefore thought, and was born of my complete love and perfect reliance on\\nmy future husband, I pushed back the music-stool, and walked straight\\nacross the room to the window.\\n\\nHis head was indeed leaned on his arms; but he was white and insensible.\\n\\n\"Come here!\" I said, sternly and commandingly, to Herbert, who stood\\nwhere I had left him. \"Now, if you can, hold him, while I wheel this\\nsofa;--and now, ring the bell, if you please.\"\\n\\nWe placed him on the couch, and Polly came running in.\\n\\n\"Now, good-night, Sir; we can take care of him. With very many thanks\\nfor your politeness,\" I added, coldly; \"and I will send home the book\\nto-morrow.\"\\n\\nHe muttered something about keeping it as long as I wished, and I turned\\nmy back on him.\\n\\n\"Oh! oh!--what had _he_ thought all this time?--what had he suffered?\\nHow his heart must have been agonized!--how terribly he must have felt\\nthe mortification,--the distress! Oh!\"\\n\\nWe recovered him at length from the dead faint into which he had fallen.\\nPolly, who thought but of the body, insisted on bringing him \"a good\\nheavy-glass of Port-wine sangaree, with toasted crackers in it\"; and\\nwouldn\\'t let him speak till he had drunken and eaten. Then she went out\\nof the room, and left me alone with my justly incensed lover.\\n\\nI took a _brioche_, and sat down humbly at the head of the sofa. He held\\nout his hand, which I took and pressed in mine,--silently, to be\\nsure; but then no words could tell how I had felt, and now felt,--how\\nhumiliated! how grieved! How wrongly I must have seemed to feel and to\\nact! how wrongly I must have acted,--though my conscience excused me\\nfrom feeling wrongly,--so to have deluded Herbert!\\n\\nAt last I murmured something regretful and tearful about Lieutenant\\nHerbert--Herbert! how I had admired that name!--and now, this Ithuriel\\ntouch, how it had changed it and him forever to me! What was in a\\nname?--sure enough! As I gazed on the pale face on the couch, I should\\nnot have cared, if it had been named Alligator,--so elevated was I\\nbeyond all I had thought or called trouble of that sort! so real was the\\ntrouble that could affect the feelings, the sensitiveness, of the noble\\nbeing before me!\\n\\nAt length he spoke, very calmly and quietly, setting down the empty\\ntumbler. I trembled, for I knew it must come.\\n\\n\"I was so glad that fool came in, Del! For, to tell the truth, I felt\\nreally too weak to talk. I haven\\'t slept for two nights, and have been\\non my feet and talking for four hours,--then I have had no dinner\"--\\n\\n\"Oh!\"\\n\\n\"And a damned intelligent jury, (I beg your pardon, but it\\'s a great\\ncomfort to swear, sometimes,) that I can\\'t humbug. But I must! I must,\\nto-morrow!\" he exclaimed, springing up from the sofa and walking\\nhurriedly across the room.\\n\\n\"Oh, do sit down, if you are so tired!\"\\n\\n\"I cannot sit down, unless you will let me stop thinking. I have but one\\nidea constantly.\"\\n\\n\"But if the man is guilty, why do you want to clear him?\" said I.\\n\\nNot a word had he been thinking of me or of Herbert all this time! But\\nthen he had been thinking of a matter of life and death. How all, all my\\nfoolish feelings took to flight! It was some comfort that my lover had\\nnot either seen or suspected them. He thought he must have been nearly\\nsenseless for some time. The last he remembered was, we were looking at\\nsome pictures.\\n\\nLaura came in from Mrs. Harris\\'s, and, hearing how the case was,\\ninsisted on having a chicken broiled, and that he should eat some\\ngreen-apple tarts, of her own cooking,--not sentimental, nor even\\nwholesome, but they suited the occasion; and we sat, after that, all\\nthree talking, till past twelve o\\'clock. No danger now, Laura said, of\\nbad dreams, if he did go to bed.\\n\\n\"But why do you care so very much, if you don\\'t get him off?--you\\nsuppose him guilty, you say?\"\\n\\n\"Because, Delphine, his punishment is abominably disproportioned to his\\noffence. This letter of the law killeth. And then I would get him off,\\nif possible, for the sake of his son and the family. And besides all\\nthat, Del, it is not for me to judge, you know, but to defend him.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,--but if you do your best?\" I inquired.\\n\\n\"A lawyer never does his best,\" he replied, hastily, \"unless he\\nsucceeds. He must get his client\\'s case, or get him off, I must get some\\nsleep to-night,\" he added, \"and take another pull. There\\'s a man on the\\njury,--he is the only one who holds out. I know I don\\'t get him. And I\\nknow why. I see it in the cold steel of his eyes. His sister was left,\\nwithin a week of their marriage-day, by a scoundrel,--left, too, to\\ndisgrace, as well as desertion,--and his heart is bitter towards all\\noffences of the sort. I must get that man somehow!\"\\n\\nHe was standing on the steps, as he spoke, and bidding me good-night;\\nbut I saw his head and heart were both full of his case, _and nothing\\nelse._\\n\\nThe words rang in my ear after he went away: \"Within a week of their\\nmarriage-day!\" In a week we were to have been married. Thank Heaven, we\\nwere still to be married in a week. And he had spoken of the man as \"a\\nscoundrel,\" who left her. America, indeed! what matters it? Still, there\\nwould be the same head, the same heart, the same manliness, strength,\\nnobleness,--all that a woman can truly honor and love. Not military, and\\nnot a scoundrel; but plain, massive, gentle, direct. He would do. And a\\nsense of full happiness pressed up to my very lips, and bubbled over in\\nlaughter.\\n\\n\"You are a happy girl, Del. Mrs. Harris says the court and everybody is\\ntalking of Mr. Sampson\\'s great plea in that Shore case. Whether he gets\\nit or not, his fortune is made. They say there hasn\\'t been such an\\nargument since Webster\\'s time,--so irresistible. It took every body off\\ntheir feet.\"\\n\\nI did not answer a word,--only clothed my soul with sackcloth and ashes,\\nand called it good enough for me.\\n\\nWe went to bed. But in the middle of the night I waked Laura.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" said she, springing out of bed.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t, Laura!--nothing,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh, I thought you were ill! I\\'ve been sleeping with one eye open, and\\njust dropped away. What is it?\"\\n\\n\"Do lie down, then. I only wanted to ask you a question.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, _do_ go to sleep! It\\'s after three o\\'clock now. We never shall get\\nup. Haven\\'t you been asleep yet?\"\\n\\n\"No,--I\\'ve been thinking all the time. But you are impatient. It\\'s no\\nmatter. Wait till to-morrow morning.\"\\n\\n\"No. I am awake now. Tell me, and be done with it, Del.\"\\n\\n\"But I shall want your opinion, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, _will_ you tell me, Del?\"\\n\\n\"Well, it is this. How do you think a handsome, a _very_ handsome\\nchess-table would do?\"\\n\\n\"Do!--for what?\"\\n\\n\"Why,--for my aunt\\'s wedding-gift, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that! And you have waked me up, at this time of night, from the\\nnicest dream! You cruel thing!\"\\n\\n\"I am so sorry, Laura! But now that you are awake, just tell me how you\\nlike the idea;--I won\\'t ask you another word.\"\\n\\n\"Very well,--very good,--excellent,\" murmured Laura.\\n\\nIn the course of the next ten minutes, however, I remembered that Laura\\nnever played chess, and that I had heard Mr. Sampson say once that he\\nnever played now,--that it was too easy for work, and too hard for\\namusement. So I put the chess-table entirely aside, and began again.\\n\\nA position for sleep is, unluckily, the one that is sure to keep one\\nawake. Lying down, all the blood in my body kept rushing to my brain,\\nkeeping up perpetual images of noun substantives. If I could have spent\\nmy fifty dollars in verbs, in taking a journey, in giving a _fete\\nchampetre_! (Garden lighted with Chinese lanterns, of course,--house\\ncovered inside and out with roses.) Things enough, indeed, there were to\\nbe bought. But the right thing!\\n\\nA house, a park, a pair of horses, a curricle, a pony-phaeton. But how\\nmany feet of ground would fifty dollars buy?--and scarcely the hoof of\\na horse.\\n\\nThere was a diamond ring. Not for me; because \"he\" had been too poor\\nto offer me one. But I could give it to him. No,--that wouldn\\'t do. He\\nwouldn\\'t wear it,--nor a pin of ditto. He had said, simplicity in dress\\nwas good economy and always good taste. No. Then something else,--that\\nwouldn\\'t wear, wouldn\\'t tear, wouldn\\'t lose, rust, break.\\n\\nAs to clothes, to which I swung back in despair,--this very Aunt Allen\\nhad always sent us all our clothes. So it would only be getting\\nmore, and wouldn\\'t seem to be anything. She was an odd kind of\\nwoman,--generous in spots, as most people are, I believe. Laura and\\nI both said, (to each other,) that, if she would allow us a hundred\\ndollars a year each, we could dress well and suitably on it. But,\\ninstead of that, she sent us every year, with her best love, a\\ntrunk full of her own clothes, made for herself, and only a little\\nworn,--always to be altered, and retrimmed, and refurbished: so that,\\nalthough worth at first perhaps even more than two hundred dollars,\\nthey came, by their unfitness and non-fitness, to be worth to us only\\nthree-quarters of that sum; and Laura and I reckoned that we lost\\nexactly fifty dollars a year by Aunt Allen\\'s queerness. So much for our\\ngratitude! Laura and I concluded it would be a good lesson to us about\\ngiving; and she had whispered to me something of the same sort, when\\nI insisted on dressing Betsy Ann Hemmenway, a little mulatto, in an\\nOriental caftan and trousers, and had promised her a red sash for her\\nwaist. To be sure, Mrs. Hemmenway despised the whole thing, and said she\\n\"wouldn\\'t let Betsy Ann be dressed up like a circus-rider, for nobody\";\\nand that she should \"wear a bonnet and mantilly, like the rest of\\nmankind.\" Which, indeed, she did,--and her bonnet rivalled the\\n_coiffures_ of Paris in brilliancy and procrastination; for it never\\ncame in sight till long after its little mistress. However, of that\\nby-and-by. I was only too glad that Aunt Allen had not sent me another\\nsilk gown \"with her best love, and, as she was only seventy, perhaps it\\nmight be useful.\" No,--here was the fifty-dollar note, thank Plutus!\\n\\nBut then, what to do with it? Sleeping, that was the question. Waking,\\nthat was the same.\\n\\nAt twelve o\\'clock Mr. Sampson came to dine with us, and to say he was\\nthe happiest of men.\\n\\n\"That is, of course, I shall be, next week,\" said he, smiling and\\ncorrecting himself. \"But I am rather happy now; for I\\'ve got my case,\\nand Shore has sailed for Australia. Good riddance, and may he never\\ntouch _these_ shores any more!\"\\n\\nHe had been shaking hands with everybody, he said,--and was so glad to\\nbe out of it!\\n\\n\"Now that it is all over, I wish you would tell me why you are so glad,\\nwhen you honestly believe the man guilty,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh, my child, you are supposing the law to be perfect. Suppose the old\\nEnglish law to be in force now, making stealing a capital offence. You\\nwouldn\\'t hang a starving woman or child who stole the baker\\'s loaf from\\nyour window-sill this morning before Polly had time to take it in, would\\nyou? Yet this was the law until quite lately.\"\\n\\n\"After all, I don\\'t quite see either how you can bear to defend him, if\\nyou think him guilty, or be glad to have him escape, if he is,--I mean,\\nsupposing the punishment to be a fair one.\"\\n\\n\"Because I am a frail and erring man, Delphine, and like to get my case.\\nIf my client is guilty,--as we will suppose, for the sake of argument,\\nhe is,--he will not be likely to stop his evil career merely because he\\nhas got off now, and will be caught and hanged next time, possibly.\\nIf he does stop sinning, why, so much the better to have time for\\nrepentance, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t laugh,--now be serious.\"\\n\\n\"I am. Once, I made up my mind as to my client\\'s guilt from what he told\\nand did not tell me, and went into court with a heavy heart. However, in\\nthe course of the trial, evidence, totally unexpected to all of us, was\\nbrought forward, and my client\\'s innocence fully established. It was a\\ngood lesson to me. I learned by experience that the business of counsel\\nis to defend or to prosecute, and not to judge. The judge and jury are\\nstereoscopic and see the whole figure.\"\\n\\nHow wise and nice it sounded! Any way, I wasn\\'t a stereoscope, for I saw\\nbut one side,--the one \"he\" was on.\\n\\nMonday morning. And we were to be married in the evening,--by ourselves,\\n--nobody else. That was all the stipulation my lover made.\\n\\n\"I will be married morning, noon, or night, as you say, and dress and\\nbehave as you say; but not in a crowd of even three persons.\"\\n\\n\"Not even Laura?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes! Laura.\"\\n\\n\"Not even Polly?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes! the household.\"\\n\\nAnd then he said, softly, that, if I wanted to please him,--and he knew\\nhis darling Del did,--I would dress in a white gown of some sort, and\\nput a tea-rose in my beautiful dark hair, and have nobody by but just\\nthe family and old Mr. Price, the Boynton minister.\\n\\n\"I know that isn\\'t what you thought of, exactly. You thought of being\\nmarried in church\"----\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, dear! old Mr. Price!\"--but I did not speak.\\n\\n\"But if you would be willing?\"----\\n\\n\"I supposed it would be more convenient,\" I muttered.\\n\\nVisions of myself walking up the aisle, with a white silk on, tulle\\nveil, orange-flowers, of course, (so becoming!) house crowded with\\nfriends, collation, walking under the trees,--all faded off with a\\nmournful cry.\\n\\nIt was of no use talking. Whatever he thought best, I should do, if it\\nwere to be married by the headsman, supposing there were such a person.\\nThis was all settled, then, and had been for a week.\\n\\nNobody need say that lovers, or even married lovers, have but one mind.\\nThey have two minds always. And that is sometimes the best of it; since\\nthe perpetual sacrifices made to each other are made no sacrifices, but\\nsweet triumphs, by their love. Still, just as much as green is composed\\nof yellow and blue, and purple of red and blue, the rays can any time\\nbe separated, and they always have a conscious life of their own. Of\\ncourse, I had a sort of pleasure even in giving up my marriage in\\nchurch; but I kept my blue rays, for all that,--and told Laura I dreaded\\nthe long, long prayer in that evening\\'s service, and that I hoped in\\nmercy old Mr. Price would have his wits about him, and not preach a\\nfuneral discourse.\\n\\n\"Old Mr. Price is eighty-nine years old, Laura says,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Yes. He was the minister who married my father and mother, and has\\nalways been our minister,\" answered my lover.\\n\\nAnd so it was settled.\\n\\nLaura was rolling up tape, Monday morning, as quietly as if there were\\nto be no wedding. For my part, I wandered up and down, and could not set\\nmyself about anything.\\n\\n\"Old Mr. Price! and a great long prayer! And that is to be the end\\nof it! My wedding-dress all made, and not to be worn! Flowers ditto!\\nNowhere to go, and so I shall stay at home. He has no house; so Taffy is\\nto come to mine!\"\\n\\nAnd here I burst out laughing; for it was as well to laugh as cry; and\\nbesides, I said a great many things on purpose to have Laura say what\\nshe always did,--and which, after all, it was sweet to me to hear. Those\\nwere silly days!\\n\\n\"No, Del,--that is not the end of it,--only the beginning of it,--of a\\nhappy, useful, good life,--your path growing brighter and broader every\\nyear,--and--and--we won\\'t talk of the garlands, dear; but your heart\\nwill have bridal-blossoms, whether your head has or not.\"\\n\\nLaura kissed me, with tears in her sisterly eyes. She never talks fine,\\nand went directly out of the room after this.\\n\\nI thought that women shouldn\\'t swear at all, or, if they did, should\\nbreak their oaths as gracefully as I did mine, when I whispered it was\\n\"_so_ good of him, to be willing I should stay in the cottage where I\\nhad always lived, and where every rose-tree and lilac knew me!\" And that\\nwas true, too. But not all the truth. What need to be telling truths all\\nthe time? And what had women tongues for, but to hold them sometimes?\\nPerhaps \"he,\" too, would have preferred a journey to Europe, and a house\\non the Mill-Dam.\\n\\nThings gradually settled themselves. My troubles seemed coming to a\\nclose by mechanical pressure. As to the name, it was better than Fire,\\nFamine, and Slaughter,--and I was to take it into consideration, any\\nway, and get used to it, if I could. The other trouble I put aside\\nfor the moment. After it was concluded on that the wedding should be\\nstrictly private, it was not necessary to buy my aunt\\'s present under\\na few days, and I could have the decided advantage, in that way, of\\navoiding a duplicate.\\n\\nThe Monday of my marriage sped away swiftly. Polly had come up early to\\nsay to \"Laury\" (for Polly was a free and independent American girl of\\nforty-five) that \"there\\'d be so much goin\\' to the door, and such, Betsy\\nAnn had best be handy by, to answer the bell. Fin\\'ly, she\\'s down there\\nwith her bunnet off, and goin\\' to stay.\"\\n\\nAs usual, Polly\\'s plans were excellent, and adopted. There would be all\\nthe wedding-presents to arrive, congratulatory notes, etc. Everything to\\narrange, and a thousand and one things that neither one nor three pairs\\nof hands could do. How I wished Betsy Ann would consent to dress like an\\nOriental child, and look pretty and picturesque,--like a Barbary slave\\nbearing vessels of gold and silver chalices, instead of her silly\\npointed waist and \"mantilly,\" which she persisted in wearing, and which,\\nof course, gave the look only of a stranger and sojourner in the land!\\n\\nI hoped she was a careful child,--there were so many things which might\\nbe spoiled, even if they came in boxes. Betsy Ann was instructed, on\\npain of--almost death, to be very, very careful, and to put everything\\non the table in the library. She was by no means to unpack an article,\\nnot even a bouquet. Laura and myself preferred to arrange everything\\nourselves. We proposed to place each of the presents, for that evening\\nonly, in the library, and spread them out as usual; but the very next\\nday, we determined, they should all be put away, wherever they were to\\ngo,--of course, we could not tell where, till we saw them. That was\\nLaura\\'s taste, and had come, on reflection, to be mine.\\n\\nLaura said she should make me presents only of innumerable stitches:\\nwhich she had done. Polly, whom it is both impossible and irrelevant to\\ndescribe, took the opportunity to scrub the house from top to bottom.\\nHer own wedding-present to me, homely though it was, I wrapped in silver\\npaper, and showed it to her lying in state on the library-table, to her\\ninfinite amusement.\\n\\nLike the North American Indian, the race of Pollies is fast going out\\nof American life. You read an advertisement of \"an American servant who\\nwants a place in a genteel family,\" and visions of something common in\\nAmerican households, when you were children, come up to your mind\\'s eye.\\nWithout considering the absurdity of an American girl calling herself by\\nsuch a name, your eyes fill with tears at the thought of the faithful\\nand loving service of years ago, when neither sickness, nor sorrow, nor\\ndeath itself separated the members of the household, but the nurse-maid\\nwas the beloved friend, living and dying under the same roof that\\nwitnessed her untiring and faithful devotion.\\n\\nSo, when you look after this \"American servant,\" you find alien blood,\\nlip-service, a surface-warmth that flatters, but does not delude,--a\\nfidelity that fails you in sickness, or increased toil, or the prospect\\nof higher wages; and you say to the \"American servant,\"--\\n\\n\"How long have you been in Boston?\"\\n\\n\"Born in Boston, Ma\\'m,--in Eliot Street, Ma\\'m.\"\\n\\nSo was not Polly. Polly had lived with us always. She had a farm of her\\nown, and needn\\'t have \"lived out\" five minutes, unless she had chosen.\\nBut she did choose it, and chose to keep her place. And that was a true\\nfriend,--in a humble position, possibly, yet one of her own choosing.\\nShe rejoiced and wept with us, knew all about us,--corresponded\\nregularly with us when away, and wrote poetry. She had a fair\\nmind, great shrewdness, and kept a journal of facts. We loved her\\ndearly,--next to each other, and a hundred times better than we did Aunt\\nAllen or any of them.\\n\\nOf course, as the day wore on, and afternoon came, and then almost night\\ncame, and still the bell had not once rung,--not once!--Polly was\\nnot the person to express or to permit the least surprise. Not Caleb\\nBalderstone himself had a sharper eye to the \"honor of the family.\"\\n_Why_ it was left to the doctrine of chances to decide. _That_ it was\\ngrew clearer and clearer every hour, as every hour came slowly by,\\nunladen with box or package, even a bouquet.\\n\\nBetsy Ann had grinned a great many times, and asked Polly over and over,\\n\"Where the presents all was?\" and, \"When I was to Miss Russell\\'s, and\\nMiss Sally was merried, the things come in with a rush,--silver, and\\ngold, and money, ever so much!\"\\n\\nHowever, here Polly snubbed her, and told her to \"shet up her head\\nquick. Most of the presents was come long ago.\"\\n\\n\"Such a piece of work as I hed to ghet up that critter\\'s mouth!\" said\\nPolly, laughing, as she assisted Laura in putting the last graces to my\\nsimple toilet before tea.\\n\\n\"There, now, Miss Sampson to be! I declare to man, you never looked\\nbetter.\\n\\n  \"\\'Roses red, violets blue,\\n  Pinks is pootty, and so be you.\\'\"\\n\\n\"How did you shut it, Polly?\" said Laura, who was very much surprised,\\nlike myself, at the non-arrivals, and who constantly imagined she\\nheard the bell. Ten arrivals we had both counted on,--ten,\\ncertainly,--fifteen, probably.\\n\\n\"Well, I told her the presents was all locked up; and if she was a\\nclever, good child, and went to school regular, and got her learnin\\'\\ngood, I\\'d certain show \\'em to her some time. I told her,\" added Polly,\\nwhisperingly, and holding her hand over her mouth to keep from loud\\nlaughter,--\"I told her I\\'d seen a couple on \\'em done up in beautiful\\nsilver paper!\"\\n\\nThe bell rang at last, and we all sprang as with an electric shock. It\\nwas old Mr. Price, led in reverently by Mr. Sampson. Tea was ready; so\\nwe all sat down to it.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what other people think of, when they are going to be\\nmarried,--I mean at the moment. Books are eloquent on the subject. For\\nmy part. I must confess, I thought of nothing. And let that encourage\\nthe next bride, who will imagine herself a dunce, because she isn\\'t\\nthinking of something fine and solemn. Perhaps I had so many ideas\\npressing in, in all directions, that the mind itself couldn\\'t act. Be\\nit as it may, I stood as if stupefied,--while old Mr. Price talked and\\nprayed, it seemed, an age. I was roused, however, and glad enough I\\nwasn\\'t in church, when he called out,--\\n\\n\"_Ameriky!_ do you take this woman for your wedded wife?\" and still more\\nrejoiced when he added, sternly,--\\n\\n\"_Delphiny!_\" (using the long _i_,) \"do you take _Ameriky?_\"\\n\\nWe both said \"Yes.\" And then he commended us affectionately and\\nreverently to the protection and love of Him who had himself come to a\\nwedding. He then came to a close, to Polly\\'s delight, who said she \"had\\nexpected nothin\\' but what the old gentleman would hold on an hour,\\n--missionaries to China, and all.\"\\n\\nOld Mr. Price took a piece of cake and a full glass of wine, and wished\\nus joy. He was fast passing away, and with him the old-class ministers,\\nnow only traditional, who drank their half-mug of flip at funerals, went\\nto balls to look benignantly on the scene of pleasure, came home at ten\\no\\'clock to write \"the improvement\" to their Sunday\\'s sermon, took the\\nother half-mug, and went to bed peaceably and in charity with the whole\\nparish. They have gone, with the stagecoaches and country-newspapers;\\nand the places that knew them will know them no more.\\n\\nBetsy Ann, who was mercifully admitted to the wedding, pronounced\\nit without hesitation the \"flattest thing she ever see,\"--and was\\nstraightway dismissed by Polly, with an extra frosted cake, and a charge\\nto \"get along home with herself.\" Then Mr. Sampson walked slowly home\\nwith Mr. Price, and Laura and myself were left looking at each other.\\n\\n\"Delphiny!\" said Laura.\\n\\n\"Ameriky!\" said I.\\n\\n\"Well,--it\\'s over now. If you had happened to be Mrs. Conant\\'s daughter,\\nyou know, your name would have been Keren-happuch!\"\\n\\n\"On the whole, I am glad it wasn\\'t in church,\" said I.\\n\\nMr. Sampson returned before we had finished talking of that. And then\\nLaura, said, suddenly,--\\n\\n\"But you _must_ decide on Aunt Allen\\'s gift, Del. What shall it be? What\\nwill be pretty?\"\\n\\n\"You shall decide,\" said I, amiably, turning to my husband.\\n\\n\"Oh, I have no notion of what is pretty,--at least of but one\\nthing,--and that is not in Aunt Allen\\'s gift.\"\\n\\nHe laughed, and I blushed, of course, as he pointed the compliment\\nstraight at me.\\n\\n\"But you _must_ think. I cannot decide, I have thought of five hundred\\nthings already.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Laura,--what do you say?\" said he.\\n\\n\"I think a silver salver would be pretty, and useful, too.\"\\n\\n\"Pretty and useful. Then let it be a silver salver, and be done with\\nit,\" said he.\\n\\nThis notion of being \"done with it\" is so mannish! Here was my Gordian\\nknot cut at once! However, there was no help for it,--though now, more\\nthan ever, since there was no danger of a duplicate, did I long for the\\nfifty thousand different beautiful things the fifty dollars would buy.\\n\\nCircumstances aided us, too, in coming to a conclusion. I was rather\\ntired of rocking on these billows of uncertainty, even with the chance\\nof plucking gems from the depths. And Mrs. Harris was coming the next\\nday to tea, and to go away early to see Piccolomini sing and sparkle.\\n\\nWhen we sat down that next day at the table, I poured the tea into a\\ncup, and placed it on the prettiest little silver tray, and Polly handed\\nit to Mrs. Harris as if she had done that particular thing all her life.\\n\\n\"Beautiful!\" said Mrs. Harris, as it sparkled along back; \"one of your\\nwedding-gifts?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I answered, carelessly,--\"Aunt Allen\\'s.\"\\n\\nSo much was well got over. My hope was that Mrs. Harris, who talked\\nwell, and was never weary of that sort of well-doing, would keep on her\\nown subjects of interest, to the exclusion of mine. Therefore, when she\\nsaid pleasantly, _en passant_,--\\n\\n\"By the way, Delphine, I see you have taken my advice about\\nwedding-presents. You know I always abominated that parading of gifts.\"\\n\\nLaura hastened to the rescue, saying,--\\n\\n\"Yes, we quite agree with you, and remember your decided opinions on\\nthat subject. Did you say you had been to the Aquarial Gardens?\"\\n\\nHow I wished I had been self-possessed enough to tell the whole story,\\nwith its ridiculous side out, and make a good laugh over it, as it\\ndeserved!--for Mrs. Harris wouldn\\'t stay in the Aquarial Gardens, which\\nshe pronounced a disgusting exhibition of \"Creep and Crawl,\" and that\\nit was all a set of little horrors; but swung back to wedding-gifts and\\nwedding-times.\\n\\n  \"\\'When I was young,--ah! woful _when!_--\\n  That I should say _when_ I was young!\\'\\n\\n\"it wasn\\'t fashionable, or, I should say, necessary, to buy something for\\na bride,\" said Mrs. Harris, meditatively, and looking back--as we could\\nsee by her eyes--a long way.\\n\\nFor my part, I thought she had much better choose some other subject,\\nconsidering everything. Certainly she had been one of the ten I had\\ncounted on. But she suddenly collected herself!\\n\\n\"I never look at a great needle-book, (\\'housewife,\\' we used to call\\nit,) full of all possible and impossible contrivances and conveniences,\\nwithout recalling my Aunt Hovey\\'s patient smile when she gave it to me.\\nShe was rheumatic, and confined for twenty years to her chair; and these\\n\\'housewives\\' she made exquisitely, and each of her young friends on her\\nwedding-day might count on one. Then Sebiah Collins,--she brought me a\\nbag of holders,--poor old soul! And Aunt Patty Hobbs gave me a bundle of\\nrags! She said, \\'Young housekeepers was allers a-wantin\\' rags, and, in\\ncourse, there wa\\'n\\'t nothin\\' but what was bran\\'-new out of the store.\\'\\nCan I ever forget the Hill children, with their mysterious movements,\\ntheir hidings, and their unaccountable absences? and then the\\nwork-basket on my toilet-table, on my wedding-morning! the little\\npin-cushions and emery-sacks, the fantastic thimble-cases, and the\\nfish-shaped needle-books! all as nice as their handy little fingers\\ncould make, and every stitch telling of their earnest love and bright\\nfaces!--Every one of those children is dead. But I keep the work-basket\\nsacred. I don\\'t know whether it is more pleasure or pain.\"\\n\\nShe looked up again, as if before her passed a long procession. I had\\noften seen that expression in the eyes of old, and even of middle-aged\\npersons, who had had much mental vicissitude, but I had not interpreted\\nit till now. It was only for a moment; and she added, cheerfully,--\\n\\n\"The future is always pleasant; so we will look that way.\"\\n\\nJust then a gentleman wished to see Mr. Sampson on business, and they\\ntwo went into the library.\\n\\nMrs. Harris talked on, and I led the way to the parlor. She said she\\nshould be called for presently; and then Laura lighted the argand, and\\ndropped the muslin curtains.\\n\\n\"Oh, isn\\'t this sweet?\" exclaimed Mrs. Harris, rapturously, approaching\\nthe table. \"How the best work of Art pales before Nature!\"\\n\\nIt was only a tall small vase of ground glass, holding a pond-lily,\\nfully opened. But it was perfect in its way, and I knew by the smile on\\nLaura\\'s lips that it was her gift.\\n\\n\"Mine is in that corner, Delphine,\" said Mrs. Harris. \"I wouldn\\'t have\\nit brought here till to-night, when I could see Laura, for fear you\\nshould have a duplicate. So here is my Mercury, that I have looked at\\ntill I love it. I wouldn\\'t give you one that had only the odor of the\\nshop about it; but you will never look at this, Del, without thoughts of\\nour little cozy room and your old friend.\"\\n\\n\"Beautiful! No, indeed! Always!\" murmured I.\\n\\nShe drew a little box from her pocket, and took out of it a taper-stand\\nof chased silver.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Gore asked me to bring it to you, with her love. She wouldn\\'t send\\nit yesterday, she said, because it would look so like nothing by the\\nside of costly gifts. Pretty, graceful little thing! isn\\'t it? It is an\\nevening-primrose, I think,--\\'love\\'s own light,\\'--hey, Delphine?\"\\n\\nWe had scarcely half admired the taper-stand and the Mercury when the\\ncarriage came for Mrs. Harris, who insisted on taking away Laura with\\nher to the opera.\\n\\n\"No matter whether you thought of going or not; and, happily, there\\'s\\nno danger of Delphine being lonely. \\'Two are company,\\' you know Emerson\\nsays, \\'but three are a congregation.\\' So they will be glad to spare you.\\nThere, now! that is all you want,--and this shawl.\"\\n\\nAfter they went, I sat listening for nearly half an hour to the low\\nmurmurs in the next room, and wishing the stranger would only go, so\\nthat I might exhibit my new treasures. At last the strange gentleman\\nopened the door softly, talking all the way, across the room, through\\nthe entry, and finally whispering himself fairly out-of-doors. When my\\nhusband came in, I was eager to show him the Mercury, and the lily, and\\nthe taper-stand.\\n\\n\"And do you know, after all, I hadn\\'t the real nobleness and\\ntruthfulness and right-mindedness to tell Mrs. Harris that these and\\nAunt Allen\\'s gift were all I had received! I am ashamed of myself, to\\nhave such a mean mortification about what is really of no importance.\\nCertainly, if my friends don\\'t care enough for me to send me something,\\nI ought to be above caring for it.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know that, Del. Your mortification is very natural. How can we\\nhelp caring? Do you like your Aunt Allen very much?\" added he, abruptly.\\n\\n\"Because she gave me fifty dollars? Yes, I begin to think I do,\" said I,\\nlaughing.\\n\\nHe looked at me quickly.\\n\\n\"Your Aunt Allen is very rich, is she not?\"\\n\\n\"I believe so. Why? You look very serious. I neither respect nor love\\nher for her riches; and I haven\\'t seen her these ten years.\"\\n\\nHe looked sober and abstracted; but when I spoke, he smiled a little.\\n\\n\"Do you remember Ella\\'s chapter on Old China?\" said he, sitting down on\\nthe sofa, and--I don\\'t mind saying--putting one arm round my waist.\\n\\n\"Yes,--why?\"\\n\\n\"Do you remember Bridget\\'s plaintive regret that they had no longer\\nthe good old times when they were poor? and about the delights of the\\nshilling gallery?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,--what made you think of it?\"\\n\\n\"What a beautiful chapter that is!--their gentle sorrow that they could\\nno longer make nice bargains for books! and his wearing new, neat, black\\nclothes, alas! instead of the overworn suit that was made to hang on\\na few weeks longer, that he might buy the old folio of Beaumont and\\nFletcher! Do you remember it, Delphine?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do. And I think there is a deal of pleasure in considering and\\ncontriving,--though it\\'s prettier in a book\"--\\n\\n\"For my part,\" interrupted my husband, as though he had not heard me\\nspeak,--\"for my part, I am sorry one cannot have such an exquisite\\nappreciation of pleasure but through pain; for--I am tired of\\nlabor--and privation--and, in short, poverty. To work so hard, and so\\nconstantly!--with such a long, weary vista before one!--and these petty\\ngains! Don\\'t you think poverty is the one thing hateful, Delphine?\"\\n\\nHe sprang up suddenly, and began walking up and down the room,--up and\\ndown,--up and down; and without speaking any more, or seeming to wish me\\nto answer.\\n\\n\"Why, what is it? What do you mean?\" said I, faintly; for my heart felt\\nlike lead in my bosom.\\n\\nHe did not answer at first, but walked towards me; then, turning\\nsuddenly away, sprang out of the window at the side of the room, saying,\\nwith a constrained laugh,--\\n\\n\"I shall be in again, presently. In the mean time I leave you to\\nmeditations on the shilling gallery!\"\\n\\nWhat a strange taunting sound his voice had! There was no insane blood\\namong the Sampsons, or I might have thought he had suddenly gone crazy.\\nOr if I had believed in demoniacal presences, I might have thought the\\nmurmuring, whispering old man was some tempter. Some evil influence\\ncertainly had been exerted over him. Scarcely less than deranged could I\\nconsider him now, to be willing thus to address me. It was true, he was\\npoor,--that he had struggled with poverty. But had it not been my pride,\\nas I thought it was his, that his battle was bravely borne, and would be\\nbravely won? I could not, even to myself, express the cruel cowardice of\\nsuch words as he had used to his helpless wife. That he felt deeply and\\ngallingly his poverty was plain. Even in that there was a weakness which\\ninduced more of contempt than pity for him; but was it not base to tell\\nme of it now? Now, when his load was doubled, he complained of the\\nburden! Why, I would have lain down and died far sooner than he should\\nhave guessed it of me. And he had thought it--and--said it!\\n\\nThere are emotions that seem to crowd and supersede each other, so\\nthat the order of time is inverted. I came to the point of disdainful\\ncomposure, even before the struggle and distress began. I sat quietly\\nwhere my husband left me,--such a long, long time! It seemed hours.\\nI remembered how thoughtful I had determined to be of all our\\nexpenses,--the little account-book in which I had already entered some\\nitems; how I had thought of various ways in which I could assist him;\\nyes, even little I was to be the most efficient and helpful of wives.\\nHad I not taken writing-lessons secretly, and formed a thorough\\nbusiness-hand, and would I not earn many half-eagles with my eagle\\'s\\nquill? I remembered how I had thought, though I had not said it, (and\\nhow glad now I was I had not!) that we would help each other in sickness\\nand health,--that we would toil up that weary hill where wealth stands\\nso lusciously and goldenly shining. But then, hand in hand we were\\nto have toiled,--hopefully, smilingly, lovingly,--not with this cold\\nrecrimination, nor, hardest of all, with--reproach!\\n\\nSuddenly, a strange suspicion fell over me. It fell down on me like a\\npall. I shuddered with the cold of it.\\n\\nI knew it wasn\\'t so. I knew he loved me,--that Le meant nothing,--that\\nit was a passing discontent, a hateful feeling engendered by the sight\\nof the costly trifles before us. Yes,--I knew that. But, good heavens!\\nto tell his wife of it!\\n\\nI sat, with my head throbbing, and holding my hands, utterly tearless;\\nfor tears were no expression of the distressful pain, and blank\\ndisappointment of a life, that I felt. I said I felt this damp, dark\\nsuspicion. It was there like a presence, but it was as indefinite as\\ndark; and I had a sort of control, in the midst of the tumult in my\\nbrain and heart, as to what thoughts I would let come to me. Not that!\\nFaults there might be,--great ones,--but not that, the greatest! At\\nleast, if I could not respect, I could forgive,--for he loved me.\\nSurely, surely, that must be true!\\n\\nIt would come, that flash, like lightning, or the unwilling memories of\\nthe drowning. I remembered the rich Miss Kate Stuart, who, they said,\\nliked him, and that her father would have been glad to have him for a\\nson-in-law. And I had asked him once about it, in the careless\\ngayety of happy love. He had said, he supposed it might have\\nhappened--perhaps--who knows?--if he had not seen me. But he had seen\\nme! Could it be that he was thinking of?\\n\\nMy calmness was giving way. As soon as I spoke, though it was only in a\\nword of ejaculation, my pity for myself broke all the flood-gates down,\\nand I fell on my face in a paroxysm of sobs.\\n\\nA very calm, loving voice, and a strong arm raising me, brought me back\\nat once from the wild ocean of passion on which I was tossing. I had not\\nheard him come in. I was too proud and grieved to speak or to weep. So I\\ndried my tears and sat stiffly silent.\\n\\n\"You are tired, dear!\" said my husband, tenderly.\\n\\n\"No,--it\\'s no matter.\"\\n\\n\"Everything is matter to me that concerns you. You know that,--you\\nbelieve that, Delphine?\"\\n\\n\"Why, what a strange sound! just as it used to sound!\" I said to myself,\\nwhisperingly.\\n\\nI know not what possessed me; but I was determined to have the truth,\\nand the whole truth. I turned towards him and looked straight into his\\neyes.\\n\\n\"Tell me, truly, as you hope God will save you at your utmost need, _do_\\nyou love me? Did you marry me from any motive but that of pure, true\\nlove?\"\\n\\n\"From no other,\" answered he, with a face of unutterable surprise; and\\nthen added, solemnly, \"And may God take me, Delphine, when you cease to\\nlove me!\"\\n\\nIt was enough. There was truth in every breath, in every glance of his\\ndeep eyes. A delicious languor took the place of the horrible tension\\nthat had been every faculty,--a repose so sweet and perfect, that, if\\nreason had placed the clearest possible proofs of my husband\\'s perfidy\\nbefore me, I should simply have smiled and fallen asleep on his true\\nheart, as I did.\\n\\nWhen I opened my eyes, I met his anxious look.\\n\\n\"Why, what has come over you, Del? I did not know you were nervous.\"\\n\\nAnd then remembering, that, although I might be weakest among the weak,\\nyet that it was his wisdom that was to sustain and comfort me, I said,--\\n\\n\"By-and-by I will tell you all about it,--certainly I will. I must tell\\nyou some time, but not to-night.\"\\n\\n\"And--I had thought to keep a secret from you, to-night, Del; but, on\\nthe whole, I shall feel better to tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,--perhaps,--perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes! Secrets are safest, told. First, then, Del, I will tell you\\nthis secret. I am very foolish. Don\\'t tell of it, will you? See here!\"\\n\\nHe held up his closed hand before my face, laughingly.\\n\\nThat man\\'s name, Del, is Drake\"----\\n\\n\"And not the Devil!\" said I to myself.\\n\\n\"Solitude Drake.\"\\n\\n\"Really? Is that it, truly? What\\'s in your hand?\"\\n\\n\"Truly,--really. He lives in Albany. He is the son of a queer man, and\\nis something of a humorist himself. I have seen one of his sons. He has\\ntwo. One\\'s name is Paraclete, and the other Preserved. His daughter is\\npretty, very, and her name is Deliverance. They call her Del, for short.\\nThey do, on my word! Worse than Delphine, is it not?\"\\n\\n\"Why, don\\'t you like my name?\" stammered I, with astonishment.\\n\\n\"Yes, very well. I don\\'t care much about names. But I can tell you,\\nUncle Zabdiel and Aunt Jerusha, \\'from whom I have expectations,\\' Del,\\nthink it is \\'just about the poorest kind of a name that ever a girl\\nhad.\\' And our Cousin Abijah thought you were named Delilah, and that\\nit was a good match for Sampson! I rectified him there; but he still\\ninsists on your being called \\'Finy,\\' in the family, to distinguish you\\nfrom the Midianitish woman.\"\\n\\n\"And so Uncle _Zabdiel_ thinks I have a poor name?\" said I, laughing\\nheartily. \"The shield looks neither gold nor silver, from which side\\nsoever we gaze. But I think _he_ might put up with _my_ name!\"\\n\\nMy husband never knew exactly what I was laughing at. And why should he?\\nI was fast overcoming my weakness about names, and thinking they were\\nnothing, compared to things, after all.\\n\\nWhen our laugh (for his was sympathetic) had subsided into a quiet\\ncheerfulness, he said, again holding up his hand,--\\n\\n\"Not at all curious, Del? You don\\'t ask what Mr. Solitude Drake wanted?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I care what he wanted: company, I suppose.\"\\n\\nAnd I went on making bad puns about solitude sweetened, and ducks and\\ndrakes, as happy people do, whose hearts are quite at ease.\\n\\n\"And you don\\'t want to know at all, Del?\" said he, laughing a little\\nnervously, and dropping from his hand an open paper into mine. \"It shall\\nbe my wedding-present to you. It is Mr. Drake\\'s retainer. Pretty stout\\none, is it not? This is what made me jump out of the window,--this and\\none other thing.\"\\n\\n\"Why, this is a draft for five hundred dollars!\" said I, reading and\\nstaring stupidly at the paper.\\n\\n\"Yes, and I am retained in that great Albany land-case. It involves\\nmillions of property. That is all, Del. But I was so glad, so happy,\\nthat I was likely to do well at last, and that I could gratify all the\\nwishes, reasonable and unreasonable, of my darling!\"\\n\\n\"Is it a good deal?\" said I, simply; for, after all, five hundred\\ndollars did not seem such an Arabian fortune.\\n\\n\"Yes, Del, a good deal. Whichever way it is decided, it will make my\\nfortune. And now--the other thing. You are sure you are very calm, and\\nall this won\\'t make you sleepless?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no! I am calm as a clock.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then,--your Aunt Allen is dead.\"\\n\\n\"Dead! Is she? Did she leave us all her money?\"\\n\\n\"Why, no, you little cormorant. She has left it all about: Legacies, and\\nAntioch College, and Destitute Societies. But I believe you have some\\nclothes left to you and Laura. Any way, the will is in there, in the\\nlibrary: Mr. Drake had a copy of it.

It\\nis a circumstance which perhaps would never have reached the knowledge\\nof the magazine-reading world, nor have been of any importance to it,\\nbut for the attendant fact that I, the writer of this article, was on\\nboard the steamer. It takes two events to make a consequence, as well as\\ntwo parties to make a bargain.\\n\\nThe sea was smooth; the air was warmish and slightly misty; the low\\ncoast showed bare sand and forests of pines. The dangerous bar of the\\nport, now partially deprived of its buoys, and with its main channel\\nrendered perilous by the hulks of sunken schooners, revealed itself\\nplainly, half a mile ahead of us, in a great crescent of yellow water,\\nplainly distinguishable from the steel-gray of the outer ocean. Two\\nor three square-rigged vessels were anchored to the southward of us,\\nwaiting for the tide or the tugs, while four or five pilot-boats tacked\\nup and down in the lazy breeze, watching for the cotton-freighters which\\nought at this season to crowd the palmetto wharves.\\n\\n\"I wish we could get the duties on those ships to pay some of our\\nmilitary bills,\" said a genteel, clean-spoken Charlestonian, to a long,\\ngreen, kindly-faced youth, from I know not what Southern military\\nacademy.\\n\\nWe had arrived off the harbor about midnight, but had not entered, for\\nlack of a beacon whereby to shape our course. Now we must wait until\\nnoon for the tide, standing off and on the while merely to keep up our\\nfires. A pilot came under our quarter in his little schooner, and told\\nus that the steamer Nashville had got out the day before with only a\\nhard bumping. No other news had he: Fort Sumter had not been taken, nor\\nassaulted; the independence of South Carolina had not been recognized;\\nvarious desirable events had not happened. In short, the political world\\nhad remained during our voyage in that chaotic _status quo_ so loved by\\nPresident Buchanan. At twelve we stood for the bar, sounding our way\\nwith extreme caution. Without accident we passed over the treacherous\\nbottom, although in places it could not have been more than eighteen\\ninches below our keel. The shores closed in on both sides as we passed\\nonward. To the south was the long, low, gray Morris Island, with its\\nextinguished lighthouse, its tuft or two of pines, its few dwellings,\\nand its invisible batteries. To the north was the long, low, gray\\nSullivan\\'s Island, a repetition of the other, with the distinctions of\\nhigher sand-rolls, a village, a regular fort, and palmettos. We passed\\nthe huge brown Moultrie House, in summer a gay resort, at present a\\nbarrack; passed the hundred scattered cottages of the island, mostly\\nuntenanted now, and looking among the sand-drifts as if they had been\\nwashed ashore at random; passed the low walls of Fort Moultrie,\\nonce visibly yellow, but now almost hidden by the new _glacis_, and\\nsurmounted by piles of barrels and bags of sand, with here and there\\npalmetto stockades as a casing for the improvised embrasures; passed its\\nblack guns, its solidly built, but rusty barracks, and its weather-worn\\npalmetto flag waving from a temporary flag-staff. On the opposite side\\nof the harbor was Fort Johnstone, a low point, exhibiting a barrack, a\\nfew houses, and a sand redoubt, with three forty-two pounders. And\\nhere, in the midst of all things, apparent master of all things, at the\\nentrance of the harbor proper, and nearly equidistant from either shore,\\nthough nearest the southern, frowned Fort Sumter, a huge and lofty\\nand solid mass of brickwork with stone embrasures, all rising from\\na foundation of ragged granite boulders washed by the tides. The\\nport-holes were closed; a dozen or so of monstrous cannon peeped from\\nthe summit; two or three sentinels paced slowly along the parapet; the\\nstars and stripes blew out from the lofty flag-staff. The plan of Fort\\nSumter may be briefly described as five-sided, with each angle just so\\nmuch truncated as to give room for one embrasure in every story. Its\\nwhole air is massive, commanding, and formidable.\\n\\nEighty or a hundred citizens, volunteers, cadets from the military\\nacademy, policemen, and <DW64>s, greeted the arrival of the Columbia at\\nher wharf. It was a larger crowd than usual, partly because a report had\\ncirculated that we should be forced to bring to off Fort Sumter and give\\nan account of ourselves, and partly because many persons in Charleston\\nhave lately been perplexed with an abundant leisure. As I drove to my\\nhotel, I noticed that the streets showed less movement of business\\nand population than when I knew them four years ago. The place seemed\\ndirtier, too,--worse paved, shabbier as to its brick-work and stucco,\\nand worse painted,--but whether through real deterioration, or by\\ncomparison with the neatly finished city which I had lately left, I\\ncannot decide. There was surely not a third of the usual shipping, nor a\\nquarter of the accustomed cotton. Here and there were wharves perfectly\\nbare, not only of masting and of freight, but even of dust, as if they\\nhad not been used for days, or possibly for weeks.\\n\\nMy old hotel was as well kept, and its table as plentiful and excellent\\nas ever. I believe we are all aware by this time that Charleston has\\nnot suffered from hunger; that beef has not sold at thirty-five cents a\\npound, but rather at ten or fifteen; that its Minute Men have not\\nbeen accustomed to come down upon its citizens for forced dinners and\\ndollars; that the State loan was taken willingly by the banks, instead\\nof unwillingly by private persons; that the rich, so far from being\\nobliged to give a great deal for the cause of Secession, have generally\\ngiven very little; that the streets are well-policed, untrodden by mobs,\\nand as orderly as those of most cities; that, in short, the revolution\\nso far has been political, and not social. At the same time exports\\nand imports have nearly ceased; business, even in the retail form, is\\nstagnant; the banks have suspended; debts are not paid.\\n\\nAfter dinner I walked up to the Citadel square and saw a drill of the\\nHome Guard. About thirty troopers, all elderly men, and several with\\nwhite hair and whiskers, uniformed in long overcoats of homespun gray,\\nwent through some of the simpler cavalry evolutions in spite of their\\nhorses\\' teeth. The Home Guard is a volunteer police force, raised\\nbecause of the absence of so many of the young men of the city at the\\nislands, and because of the supposed necessity of keeping a strong hand\\nover the <DW64>s. A malicious citizen assured me that it was in training\\nto take Fort Sumter by charging upon it at low water. On the opposite\\nside of the square from where I stood rose the Citadel, or military\\nacademy, a long and lofty reddish-yellow building, stuccoed and\\ncastellated, which, by the way, I have seen represented in one of our\\nillustrated papers as the United States Arsenal. Under its walls\\nwere half a dozen iron cannon which I judged at that distance to be\\ntwenty-four pounders. A few <DW64>s, certainly the most leisurely part\\nof the population at this period, and still fewer white people, leaned\\nover the shabby fence and stared listlessly at the horsemen, with the\\nair of people whom habit had made indifferent to such spectacles. Near\\nme three men of the middle class of Charleston talked of those two\\neternal subjects, Secession and Fort Sumter. One of them, a rosy-faced,\\nkindly-eyed, sincere, seedy, pursy gentleman of fifty, congratulated the\\nothers and thanked God because of the present high moral stand of South\\nCarolina, so much loftier than if she had seized the key to her main\\nharbor, when she had the opportunity. Her honor was now unspotted; her\\ngood faith and her love of the right were visible to the whole world;\\nwhile the position of the Federal Government was disgraced and sapped by\\nfalsity. Better Sumter treacherously in the hands of the United States\\nthan in the hands of South Carolina; better suffer for a time under\\nphysical difficulties than forever under moral dishonor.\\n\\nSimple-hearted man, a fair type of his fellow-citizens, he saw but his\\nown side of the question, and might fairly claim in this matter to\\nbe justified by his faith. His bald crown, sandy side-locks, reddish\\nwhiskers, sanguineous cheeks, and blue eyes were all luminous with\\nconfidence in the integrity of his State, and with scorn for the\\nmeanness and wickedness of her enemies. No doubt had he that the fort\\nought to be surrendered to South Carolina; no suspicion that the\\nGovernment could show a reason for holding it, aside from low\\nself-interest and malice. He was the honest mouthpiece of a most\\npeculiar people, local in its opinions and sentiments beyond anything\\nknown at the North, even in self-poised Boston. Changing his subject, he\\nspoke with hostile, yet chivalrous, respect of the pluck of the Black\\nRepublicans in Congress. They had never faltered; they had vouchsafed no\\nhint of concession; while, on the other hand, Southerners had shamed him\\nby their craven spirit. It grieved, it mortified him, to see such a man\\nas Crittenden on his knees to the North, begging, actually with tears,\\nfor what he ought to demand as a right, with head erect and hands\\nclenched. He departed with a mysterious allusion to some secret of his\\nfor taking Fort Sumter,--some disagreeably odorous chemical\\npreparation, I guessed, by the scientific terms in which he beclouded\\nhimself,--something which he expected would soon be called for by the\\nGovernor. May he never smell anything worse, even in the other world,\\nthan his own compounds! Unionist, and perhaps Consolidationist, as I\\nam, I could not look upon his honest, persuaded face, and judge him a\\ntraitor, at least not to any sentiment of right that was in his own\\nsoul.\\n\\nOur hotel was full of legislators and volunteer officers, mostly\\nplanters or sons of planters, and almost without exception men of\\nstanding and property. South Carolina is an oligarchy in spirit, and\\nallows no plebeians in high places. Two centuries of plenteous feeding\\nand favorable climate showed their natural results in the _physique_ of\\nthese people. I do not think that I exaggerate, when I say that they\\naveraged six feet or nearly in height, and one hundred and seventy\\npounds or thereabouts in weight. One or two would have brought in money,\\nif enterprisingly heralded as Swiss or Belgian giants. The general\\nphysiognomy was good, mostly high-featured, often commanding, sometimes\\nremarkable for massive beauty of the Jovian type, and almost invariably\\ndistinguished by a fearless, open-eyed frankness, in some instances\\nrunning into arrogance and pugnacity. I remember one or two elderly\\nmen, in particular, whose faces would help an artist to idealize a\\nLacedaemonian general, or a baron of the Middle Ages. In dress somewhat\\ncareless, and wearing usually the last fashion but one, they struck me\\nas less tidy than the same class when I saw it four years ago; and I\\nmade a similar remark concerning the citizens of Charleston,--not only\\nmen, but women,--from whom dandified suits and superb silks seem to have\\ndeparted during the present martial time. Indeed, I heard that economy\\nwas the order of the day; that the fashionables of Charleston bought\\nnothing new, partly because of the money pressure, and partly because\\nthe guns of Major Anderson might any day send the whole city into\\nmourning; that patrician families had discharged their foreign cooks and\\nput their daughters into the kitchen; that there were no concerts, no\\nballs, and no marriages. Even the volunteers exhibited little of the\\npomp and vanity of war. The small French military cap was often the only\\nsign of their present profession. The uniform, when it appeared, was\\nfrequently a coarse homespun gray, charily trimmed with red worsted, and\\nstained with the rains and earth of the islands. One young dragoon in\\nthis sober dress walked into our hotel, trailing the clinking steel\\nscabbard of his sabre across the marble floor of the vestibule with a\\nwarlike rattle which reminded me of the Austrian officers whom I used\\nto see, yes, and hear, stalking about the _cafe\\'s_ of Florence. Half a\\ndozen surrounded him to look at and talk about the weapon. A portly,\\nmiddle-aged legislator must draw it and cut and thrust, with a smile of\\nboyish satisfaction between his grizzled whiskers, bringing the point so\\nnear my nose, in his careless eagerness, that I had to fall back upon\\na stronger, that is, a more distant position. Then half a dozen others\\nmust do likewise, their eyes sparkling like those of children examining\\na new toy.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not very sharp,\" said one, running his thumb carefully along the\\nedge of the narrow and rather light blade.\\n\\n\"Sharp enough to cut a man\\'s head open,\" averred the dragoon.\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s a dam\\' shame that sixty-five men tharr in Sumter should make\\nsuch an expense to the State,\" declared a stout, blonde young rifleman,\\nspeaking with a burr which proclaimed him from the up-country. \"We\\nhaven\\'t even troyed to get \\'em out. We ought at least to make a troyal.\"\\n\\nAll strangers at Charleston walk to the Battery. It is the extreme point\\nof the city peninsula, its right facing on the Ashley, its left on the\\nCooper, and its outlook commanding the entire harbor, with Fort Sumter,\\nPort Pinckney, Fort Moultrie, and Fort Johnstone in the distance. Plots\\nof thin clover, a perfect wonder in this grassless land; promenades,\\nneatly fenced, and covered with broken shells instead of gravel; a\\nhandsome bronze lantern-stand, twenty-five feet high, meant for a\\nbeacon; a long and solid stone quay, the finest sea-walk in the United\\nStates; a background of the best houses in Charleston, three-storied and\\nfaced with verandas: such are the features of the Battery. Lately\\nfour large iron guns, mounted like field-pieces, form an additional\\nattraction to boys and soldierly-minded men. Nobody knew their calibre;\\nthe policemen who watched them could not say; the idlers who gathered\\nabout them disputed upon it: they were eighteen pounders; they were\\ntwenty-fours; they were thirty-sixes. Nobody could tell what they were\\nthere for. They were aimed at Fort Sumter, but would not carry half way\\nto it. They could hit Fort Pinckney, but that was not desirable. The\\npoliceman could not explain; neither could the idlers; neither can I.\\nAt last it got reported about the city that they were to sink any boats\\nwhich might come down the river to reinforce Anderson; though how the\\nboats were to get into the river, whether by railroad from Washington,\\nor by balloon from the Free States, nobody even pretended to guess.\\nStanding on this side of the Ashley, and looking across it, you\\nnaturally see the other side. The long line of nearly dead level, with\\nits stretches of thin pine-forest and its occasional glares of open\\nsand, gives you an idea of nearly the whole country about Charleston,\\nexcept that in general you ought to add to the picture a number of noble\\nevergreen oaks bearded with pendent, weird Spanish moss, and occasional\\ngreen spikes of the tropical-looking Spanish bayonet. Of palmettos there\\nare none that I know of in this immediate region, save the hundred or\\nmore on Sullivan\\'s Island and the one or two exotics in the streets\\nof Charleston. In the middle of the Ashley, which is here more than a\\nquarter of a mile wide, lies anchored a topsail schooner, the nursery\\nof the South Carolina navy. I never saw it sail anywhere; but then my\\nopportunities of observation were limited. Quite a number of boys are on\\nboard of it, studying maritime matters; and I can bear witness that they\\nare sufficiently advanced to row themselves ashore. Possibly they are\\nmoored thus far up the stream to guard them from sea-sickness, which\\nmight be discouraging to young sailors. However, I ought not to talk on\\nthis subject, for I am the merest civilian and land-lubber.\\n\\nMy first conversation in Charleston on Secession was with an estimable\\nfriend, Northern-born, but drawing breath of Southern air ever since he\\nattained the age of manhood. After the first salutation, he sat down,\\nhis hands on his knees, gazing on the floor, and shaking his head\\nsoberly, if not sadly.\\n\\n\"You have found us in a pretty fix,--in a pretty fix!\"\\n\\n\"But what are you going to do? Are you really going out? You are not a\\npolitician, and will tell me the honest facts.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, we are going out,\\'--there is no doubt of it, I have not been a\\nseceder,--I have even been called one of the disaffected; but I am\\nobliged to admit that secession is the will of the community. Perhaps\\nyou at the North don\\'t believe that we are honest in our professions and\\nactions. We are so. The Carolinians really mean to go out of the Union,\\nand don\\'t mean to come back. They say that they _are_ out, and they\\nbelieve it. And now, what are you going to do with us? What is the\\nfeeling at the North?\"\\n\\n\"The Union must and shall be preserved, at all hazards. That famous\\ndeclaration expresses the present Northern popular sentiment. When I\\nleft, people were growing martial; they were joining military companies;\\nthey wanted to fight; they were angry.\"\\n\\n\"So I supposed. That agrees with what I hear by letter. Well, I am very\\nsorry for it. Our people here will not retreat; they will accept a war,\\nfirst. If you preserve the Union, it must be by conquest. I suppose you\\ncan do it, if you try hard enough. The North is a great deal stronger\\nthan the South; it can desolate it,--crush it. But I hope it won\\'t be\\ndone. I wish you would speak a good word for us, when you go back. You\\ncan destroy us, I suppose. But don\\'t you think it would be inhuman?\\nDon\\'t you think it would be impolitic? Do you think it would result in\\nsufficient good to counterbalance the evident and certain evil?\"\\n\\n\"Why, people reason in this way. They say, that, even if we allow the\\nfinal independence of the seceding States, we must make it clear that\\nthere is no such thing as the right of secession, but only that of\\nrevolution or rebellion. We must fix a price for going out of the Union,\\nwhich shall be so high that henceforward no State will ever be willing\\nto pay it. We must kill, once for all, the doctrine of peaceable\\nsecession, which is nothing else than national disintegration and ruin.\\nLieutenant-Governor Morton of Indiana declares in substance that England\\nnever spent blood and money to wiser purpose than when she laid down\\nfifty thousand lives and one hundred millions of pounds to prevent her\\nthirteen disaffected colonies from having their own way. No English\\ncolony since has been willing to face the tremendous issue thus offered\\nit. Just so it is the interest, it is the sole safety of the Federal\\nGovernment, to try to hold in the Cotton States by force, and, if they\\ngo out, to oblige them to pay an enormous price for the privilege.\\nRevolution is a troublesome luxury, and ought to be made expensive. That\\nis the way people talk at the North and at Washington. They reason thus,\\nyou see, because they believe that this is not a league, but a nation.\"\\n\\n\"And our people believe that the States are independent and have a right\\nto recede from the Confederation without asking its leave. With few\\nexceptions, all agree on that; it is honest, common public opinion. The\\nSouth Carolinians sincerely think that they are exercising a right, and\\nyou may depend that they will not be reasoned nor frightened out of it;\\nand if the North tries coercion, there will be war. I don\\'t say this\\ndefiantly, but sadly, and merely because I want you to know the truth.\\nWar is abhorrent to my feelings,--especially a war with our own\\nbrethren: and then _we_ are so poorly prepared for it!\"\\n\\nSuch was the substance of several conversations. The reader may rely, I\\nthink, on the justness of my friend\\'s opinions, founded as they are on\\nhis honesty of intellect, his moderation, and his opportunities for\\nstudying his fellow-citizens. All told me the same story, but generally\\nwith more passion, sometimes with defiance; defiance toward the\\nGovernment, I mean, and not toward me personally; for the better classes\\nof Charleston are eminently courteous. South Carolina had seceded\\nforever, defying all the hazards; she would accept nothing but\\nindependence or destruction; she did not desire any supposable\\ncompromise; she had altogether done with the Union. Yet her desire was\\nnot for war; it was simply and solely for escape. She would forget all\\nher wrongs and insults, she would seek no revenge for the injurious\\npast, provided she were allowed to depart without a conflict. Nearly\\nevery man with whom I talked began the conversation by asking if the\\nNorth meant coercion, and closed it by deprecating hostilities and\\naffirming the universal wish for _peaceable_ secession. In case of\\ncompulsion, however, the State would accept the gage of battle; her\\nsister communities of the South would side with her, the moment they saw\\nher blood flow; Northern commerce would be devoured by privateers of all\\nnations under the Southern flag; Northern manufactures would perish for\\nlack of Southern raw material and Southern consumers; Northern banks\\nwould suspend, and Northern finances go into universal insolvency; the\\nSouthern ports would be opened forcibly by England and France, who must\\nhave cotton; the South would flourish in the struggle, and the North\\ndecay.\\n\\n\"But why do you venture on this doubtful future?\" I asked of one\\ngentleman. \"What is South Carolina\\'s grievance? The Personal-Liberty\\nBills?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,--they constitute a grievance. And yet not much of one. Some of us\\neven--the men of the \\'Mercury\\' school, I mean--do not complain of the\\nUnion because of those bills. They say that it is the Fugitive-Slave Law\\nitself which is unconstitutional; that the rendition of runaways is\\na State affair, in which the Federal Government has no concern; that\\nMassachusetts, and other States, were quite right in nullifying an\\nillegal and aggressive statute. Besides, South Carolina has lost very\\nfew slaves.\"\\n\\n\"Is it the Territorial Question which forces you to quit us?\"\\n\\n\"Not in its practical issues. The South needs no more territory; has not\\n<DW64>s to colonize it. The doctrine of \\'No more Slave States\\' is an\\ninsult to us, but hardly an injury. The flow of population has settled\\nthat matter. You have won all the Territories, not even excepting New\\nMexico, where slavery exists nominally, but is sure to die out under the\\nhostile influences of unpropitious soil and climate. The Territorial\\nQuestion has become a mere abstraction. We no longer talk of it.\"\\n\\n\"Then your great grievance is the election of Lincoln?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"And the grievance is all the greater because he was elected according\\nto all the forms of law?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"If he had been got into the Presidency by trickery, by manifest\\ncheating, your grievance would have been less complete?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Is Lincoln considered here to be a bad or dangerous man?\"\\n\\n\"Not personally. I understand that he is a man of excellent private\\ncharacter, and I have nothing to say against him as a ruler, inasmuch as\\nhe has never been tried. Mr. Lincoln is simply a sign to us that we are\\nin danger, and must provide for our own safety.\"\\n\\n\"You secede, then, solely because you think his election proves that the\\nmass of the Northern people is adverse to you and your interests?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"So Mr. Wigfall of Texas hit the nail on the head, when he said\\nsubstantially that the South cannot be at peace with the North until the\\nlatter concedes that slavery is right?\"\\n\\n\"Well,--I admit it; that is precisely it.\"\\n\\nI desire the reader to note the loyal frankness, the unshrinking honesty\\nof these avowals, so characteristic of the South Carolina _morale_.\\nWhenever the native of that State does an act or holds an opinion, it is\\nhis nature to confess it and avow the motives thereof, without quibbling\\nor hesitation. It is a persuaded, self-poised community, strikingly like\\nits negative pole on the Slavery Question, Massachusetts. All those\\nCharlestonians whom I talked with I found open-hearted in their\\nsecession, and patient of my open-heartedness as an advocate of the\\nUnion, although often astonished, I suspect, that any creature capable\\nof drawing a conclusion from two premises should think so differently\\nfrom themselves.\\n\\n\"But have you looked at the platform of the Republicans?\" I proceeded.\\n\"It is not adverse to slavery in the States; it only objects to its\\nentrance into the Territories; it is not an Abolition platform.\"\\n\\n\"We don\\'t trust in the platform; we believe that it is an incomplete\\nexpression of the party creed,--that it suppresses more than it utters.\\nThe spirit which keeps the Republicans together is enmity to slavery,\\nand that spirit will never be satisfied until the system is extinct.\"\\n\\n\"Finally,--yes; gradually and quietly and safely,--that is possible. I\\nsuppose that the secret and generally unconscious _animus_ of the party\\nis one which will abolitionize it after a long while.\"\\n\\n\"When will it begin to act in an abolition sense, do you think?\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t say: perhaps a hundred years from now; perhaps two hundred.\"\\n\\nThere was a general laugh from the half-dozen persons who formed the\\ngroup.\\n\\n\"What time do _you_ fix?\" I inquired.\\n\\n\"Two years. But for this secession of ours, there would have been bills\\nbefore Congress within two years, looking to the abolition of slavery in\\nthe navy-yards, the District of Columbia, etc. That would be only the\\npoint of the wedge, which would soon assume the dimensions of an attack\\non slavery in the States. Look how aggressive the party has been in the\\nquestion of the Territories.\"\\n\\n\"The questions are different. When Congress makes local laws for Utah,\\nit does not follow that it will do likewise for South Carolina. You\\nmight as well infer, that, because a vessel sails from Liverpool to New\\nYork in ten days, therefore it will sail overland to St. Louis in five\\nmore.\"\\n\\nIncredulous laughter answered me again. The South has labored under two\\ndelusions: first, that the Republicans are Abolitionists; second, that\\nthe North can be frightened. Back of these, rendering them fatally\\neffective, lies that other delusion, the imagined right of peaceable\\nsecession, founded on a belief in the full and unresigned sovereignty of\\nthe States. Let me tell a story illustrative of the depth to which\\nthis belief has penetrated. Years ago, a friend of mine, talking to a\\nCharleston boy about patriotism, asked him, \"What is the name of your\\ncountry?\" \"South Carolina!\" responded the eight-year-old, promptly and\\nproudly. What Northern boy, what Massachusetts boy even, would not have\\nreplied, \"The United States of America\"?\\n\\nSouth Carolina, I am inclined to think, has long been a disunionist\\ncommunity, or nearly so, deceived by the idea that the Confederation is\\na bar rather than a help to her prosperity, and waiting only for a good\\nchance to quit it. Up to the election of Lincoln all timid souls were\\nagainst secession; now they are for it, because they think it less\\ndangerous than submission. For instance, when I asked one gentleman what\\nthe South expected to gain by going out, he replied, \"First, safety.\\nOur slaves have heard of Lincoln,--that he is a black man, or black\\nRepublican, or black something,--that he is to become ruler of this\\ncountry on the fourth of March,--that he is a friend of theirs, and will\\nfree them. We must establish our independence in order to make them\\nbelieve that they are beyond his help. We have had to hang some of them\\nin Alabama,--and we expect to be obliged to hang others, perhaps many.\"\\n\\nThis was not the only statement of the sort which I heard in Charleston.\\nOther persons assured me of the perfect fidelity of the <DW64>s, and\\ndeclared that they would even fight against Northern invaders, if\\nneedful. Skepticism in regard to this last comfortable belief is,\\nhowever, not wanting.\\n\\n\"If it comes to a war, you have one great advantage over us,\" said to me\\na military gentleman, lately in the service of the United States. \"Your\\nworking-class is a fighting-class, and will constitute the rank and file\\nof your armies. Our working-class is not a fighting-class. Indeed, there\\nis some reason to fear, that, if it take up arms at all, it will be on\\nthe wrong side.\"\\n\\nMy impression is, that a prevalent, though not a universal fear, existed\\nlest the <DW64>s should rise in partial insurrections on or about the\\nfourth of March. A Northern man, who had lived for several years in\\nthe back-country of South Carolina, had married there, and had lately\\ntravelled through a considerable portion of the South, informed me that\\nmany of the villages were lately forming Home Guards, as a measure of\\ndefence against the slave population. The Home Guard is frequently a\\ncavalry corps, and is always composed of men who have passed the usual\\nterm of military service; for it is deemed necessary to reserve the\\nyouth of the country to meet the \"Northern masses,\" the \"Federal\\nmercenaries,\" on the field of possible battle. By letters from\\nMontgomery, Alabama, I learn that unusual precautions have been common\\nduring the last winter, many persons locking up their <DW64>s over\\nnight in the quarters, and most sleeping with arms at hand, ready for\\nnocturnal conflict. Whoever considers the necessarily horrible nature\\nof a servile insurrection will find in it some palliation for Southern\\nviolence toward suspected incendiaries and Southern precipitation in\\nmatters of secession, however strongly he may still maintain that\\nlynch-law should not usurp the place of justice, nor revolution the\\nplace of regular government If you live in a powder-magazine, you\\npositively must feel inhospitably inclined towards a man who presents\\nhimself with a cigar in his mouth. Even if he shows you that it is but a\\ntireless stump, it still makes you uneasy. And if you catch sight of\\na multitude of smokers, distant as yet, but apparently intent on\\napproaching, you will be very apt to rush toward them, deprecate their\\nadvance, forbid it, or possibly threaten armed resistance, even at the\\nrisk of being considered aggressive.\\n\\nAre all the South Carolinians disunionists? It seemed so when I was\\nthere in January, 1861, and yet it did not seem so when I was there in\\n1855 and \\'56. At that time you could find men in Charleston who held\\nthat the right of secession was but the right of revolution, of\\nrebellion,--well enough, if successful, but inductive to hanging, if\\nunfortunate. Now those same men nearly all argue for the right of\\npeaceable secession, declaring that the State has a right to go out at\\nwill, and that the Federal Government has no right to coerce or punish\\nit. These turncoats are the sympathetic, who are carried away by a\\nrush of popular enthusiasm, and the fearful or peaceable, who dread or\\ndislike violence. Let us see how a timid Unionist can be converted into\\nan advocate of the right of secession. Let us suppose a boat with three\\nmen on board, which is hailed by a revenue-cutter, with a threat of\\nfiring, if she does not come to. Two of these men believe that the\\nrevenue-officer is performing a legal duty, and desire to obey him; but\\nthe third, a reckless, domineering fellow, seizes the helm, lets the\\nsail fill, and attempts to run by, meantime declaring at the top of his\\nvoice that the cutter has no business to stop his progress. The others\\ndare not resist him and cannot persuade him. Now, then, what position\\nwill they take as to the right of the revenue-officer to fire? Ten to\\none they will join their comrade whom they lately opposed; they will cry\\nout, that the pursuer was wrong in ordering them to stop, and ought not\\nto punish them for disobedience; in short, they will be converted by the\\ninstinct of self-preservation into advocates of the right of peaceable\\nsecession. I understand, indeed I know, that there are a few opponents\\nof disunion remaining In South Carolina; but, although they are wealthy\\npeople and of good position, it is pretty certain that they have not an\\natom of political influence.\\n\\nSecession peaceable! It is what is most particularly desired at\\nCharleston, and, I believe, throughout the Cotton States. Certainly,\\nwhen I was there, the war-party, the party of the \"Mercury,\" was not in\\nthe ascendant, unless in the sense of having been \"hoist with its own\\npetard\" when it cried out for immediate hostilities. Not only Governor\\nPickens and his Council, but nearly all the influential citizens, were\\nopposed to bloodshed. They demanded independence and Fort Sumter, but\\ndesired and hoped to get both by argument. They believed, or tried to\\nbelieve, that at last the Administration would hearken to reason and\\ngrant to South Carolina what it seemed to them could not be denied her\\nwith justice. The battle-cry of the \"Mercury,\" urging precipitation\\neven at the expense of defeat, for the sake of uniting the South, was\\nlistened to without enthusiasm, except by the young and thoughtless.\\n\\n\"We shall never attack Fort Sumter,\" said one gentleman. \"Don\\'t you see\\nwhy? I have a son in the trenches, my next neighbor has one, everybody\\nin the city has one. Well, we shan\\'t let our boys fight; we can\\'t bear\\nto lose them. We don\\'t want to risk our handsome, genteel, educated\\nyoung fellows against a gang of Irishmen, Germans, British deserters,\\nand New York roughs, not worth killing, and yet instructed to kill to\\nthe best advantage. We can\\'t endure it, and we shan\\'t do it.\"\\n\\nThis repugnance to stake the lives of South Carolina patricians against\\nthe lives of low-born, mercenaries was a feeling that I frequently heard\\nexpressed. It was betting guineas against pennies, and on a limited\\nstock of guineas.\\n\\nOther men, anti-secessionists even, assured me that war was inevitable,\\nthat Fort Sumter would be attacked, that the volunteers were panting for\\nthe strife, that Governor Pickens was excessively unpopular because of\\nhis peaceful inclinations, and that he would soon be forced to give the\\nsignal for battle. Once or twice I was seriously invited to stay a few\\ndays longer, in order to witness the struggle and victory of South\\nCarolina. However, it was clear that the enthusiasm and confidence of\\nthe people were no longer what they had been. Several dull and costly\\nweeks had passed since the passage of the secession ordinance.\\nStump-speeches, torchlight-processions, fireworks, and other\\njubilations, were among bygone things. The flags were falling to pieces,\\nand the palmettos withering, unnoticed except by strangers. Men had\\nbegun to realize that a hurrah is not sufficient to carry out a great\\nrevolution successfully; that the work which they had undertaken was\\nweightier, and the reward of it more distant, if not more doubtful, than\\nthey had supposed. The political prophets had been forced, like the\\nMillerites, to ask an extension for their predictions. The anticipated\\nfleet of cotton-freighters had not arrived from Europe, and the expected\\ntwelve millions of foreign gold had not refilled the collapsed banks.\\nThe daily expenses were estimated at twenty thousand dollars; the\\ntreasury was in rapid progress of depletion; and as yet no results. It\\nis not wonderful, that, under these circumstances, the most enthusiastic\\nsecessionists were not gay, and that the general physiognomy of the city\\nwas sober, not to say troubled. It must not be understood, however,\\nthat there was any visible discontent or even discouragement. \"We are\\nsuffering in our affairs,\" said a business-man to me; \"but you will\\nhear no grumbling.\" \"We expect to be poor, very poor, for two or three\\nyears,\" observed a lady; \"but we are willing to bear it, for the sake of\\nthe noble and prosperous end.\" \"Our people do not want concessions,\\nand will never be tempted back into the Union,\" was the voice of every\\nprivate person, as well as of the Legislature. \"I hope the Republicans\\nwill offer no compromise,\" remarked one excellent person who has not\\nfavored the revolution. \"They would be sure to see it rejected: that\\nwould humiliate them and anger them; then there would be more danger of\\nwar.\"\\n\\nHatred of Buchanan, mingled with contempt for him, I found almost\\nuniversal. If any Northerner should ever get into trouble in South\\nCarolina because of his supposed abolition tendencies, I advise him to\\nbestow a liberal cursing on our Old Public Functionary, assuring him\\nthat he will thereby not only escape tar and feathers, but acquire\\npopularity. The Carolinians called the then President double-faced\\nand treacherous, hardly allowing him the poor credit of being a\\nwell-intentioned imbecile. Why should they not consider him false? Up to\\nthe garrisoning of Fort Sumter he favored the project of secession full\\nas decidedly as he afterwards crossed it. Did he think that he was\\nlaying a train to blow the Republicans off their platform, and leave off\\nhis labor in a fright, when he found that the powder-bags to be exploded\\nhad been placed under the foundations of the Union? The man who could\\nexplain Mr. Buchanan would have a better title than Daniel Webster to be\\ncalled The Great Expounder.\\n\\nDuring the ten days of my sojourn, Charleston was full of surprising\\nreports and painful expectations. If a door slammed, we stopped talking,\\nand looked at each other; and if the sound was repeated, we went to\\nthe window and listened for Fort Sumter. Every strange noise was\\nmetamorphosed by the watchful ear into the roar of cannon or the rush of\\nsoldiery. Women trembled at the salutes which were fired in honor of the\\nsecession of other States, fearing lest the struggle had commenced and\\nthe dearly-loved son or brother in volunteer uniform was already under\\nthe storm of the columbiads. One day, a reinforcement was coming to\\nAnderson, and the troops must attack him before it arrived; the next\\nday, Florida had assaulted Fort Pickens, and South Carolina was bound\\nto dash her bare bosom against Fort Sumter. The batteries were strong\\nenough to make a breach; and then again, the best authorities had\\ndeclared them not strong enough. A columbiad throwing a ball of one\\nhundred and twenty pounds, sufficient to crack the strongest embrasures,\\nwas on its way from some unknown region. An Armstrong gun capable of\\ncarrying ten miles had arrived or was about to arrive. No one inquired\\nwhether Governor Pickens had suspended the law of gravitation in South\\nCarolina, in view of the fact that ordinarily an Armstrong gun will not\\ncarry five miles,--nor whether, in such case, the guns of Fort Sumter\\nmight not also be expected to double their range. Major Anderson was\\na Southerner, who would surrender rather than shed the blood of\\nfellow-Southerners. Major Anderson was an army-officer, incapable by his\\nprofessional education of comprehending State rights, angry because he\\nhad been charged with cowardice in withdrawing from Fort Moultrie, and\\nresolved to defend himself to the death.\\n\\nIn the mean time, the city papers were strangely deficient in local news\\nconcerning the revolution,--possibly from a fear of giving valuable\\nmilitary information to the enemy at Washington. Uselessly did I study\\nthem for particulars concerning the condition of the batteries, and\\nthe number of guns and troops,--finding little in them but mention\\nof parades, soldierly festivities, offers of service by enthusiastic\\ncitizens, and other like small business. I thought of visiting the\\nislands, but heard that strangers were closely watched there, and that\\na permit from authority to enter the forts was difficult to obtain.\\nFortune, or rather, misfortune, favored me in this matter.\\n\\nAfter passing six days in Charleston, hearing much that was\\nextraordinary, but seeing little, I left in the steamer Columbia for New\\nYork. The main opening to the harbor, or Ship Channel, as it is called,\\nbeing choked with sunken vessels, and the Middle Channel little known,\\nour only resource for exit was Maffitt\\'s Channel, a narrow strip of deep\\nwater closely skirting Sullivan\\'s Island. It was half-past six in the\\nmorning, slightly misty and very quiet Passing Fort Sumter, then Fort\\nMoultrie, we rounded a low break-water, and attempted to take the\\nchannel. I have heard a half-dozen reasons why we struck; but all I\\nventure to affirm is that we did strike. There was a bump; we hoped it\\nwas the last:--there was another; we hoped again:--there was a third; we\\nstopped. The wheels rolled and surged, bringing the fine sand from\\nthe bottom and changing the green waters to yellow; but the Columbia\\nremained inert under the gray morning sky, close alongside of the brown,\\ndamp beach of Sullivan\\'s Island. There was only a faint breeze, and a\\nmere ripple of a sea; but even those slight forces swung our stern far\\nenough toward the land to complete our helplessness. We lay broadside to\\nthe shore, in the centre of a small crescent or cove, and, consequently,\\nunable to use our engines without forcing either bow or stern higher\\nup on the sloping bottom. The Columbia tried to advance, tried to back\\nwater, and then gave up the contest, standing upright on her flat\\nflooring with no motion beyond an occasional faint bumping. The tugboat\\nAid, half a mile ahead of us, cast off from the vessel which it was\\ntaking out, and came to our assistance. Apparently it had been engaged\\nduring the night in watching the harbor; for on deck stood a score of\\nvolunteers in gray overcoats, while the naval-looking personage with\\ngrizzled whiskers who seemed to command was the same Lieutenant Coste\\nwho transferred the revenue-cutter Aiken from the service of the United\\nStates to that of South Carolina. The Aid took hold of us, broke a large\\nnew hawser after a brief struggle, and then went up to the city to\\nreport our condition.\\n\\nThe morning was lowery, with driving showers running through it from\\ntime to time, and an atmosphere penetratingly damp and cheerless. On the\\nbeach two companies of volunteers were drilling in the rain, no doubt\\ngetting an appetite for breakfast. Without uniforms, their trousers\\ntucked into their boots, and here and there a white blanket fastened\\nshawl-like over the shoulders, they looked, as one of our passengers\\nobserved, like a party of returned Californians. Their line was uneven,\\ntheir wheeling excessively loose, their evolutions of the simplest and\\nyet awkwardly executed. Evidently they were newly embodied, and from the\\ncountry; for the Charleston companies are spruce in appearance and well\\ndrilled. Half a dozen of them, who had been on sentinel duty during the\\nnight, discharged their guns in the air,--a daily process, rendered\\nnecessary by the moist atmosphere of the harbor at this season; and\\nthen, the exercise being over, there was a general scamper for the\\nshelter of a neighboring cottage, low-roofed and surrounded by a veranda\\nafter the fashion of Sullivan\\'s Island. Within half an hour they\\nreappeared in idle squads, and proceeded to kill the heavy time\\nby staring at us as we stared at them. One individual, learned in\\nsea-phrase, insulted our misfortune by bawling, \"Ship ahoy!\" A fellow\\nin a red shirt, who looked more like a Bowery _bhoy_ than like a\\nCarolinian, hailed the captain to know if he might come aboard;\\nwhereupon he was surrounded by twenty others, who appeared to\\nquestion him and confound him until he thought it best to disappear\\nunostentatiously. I conjectured that he was a hero of Northern birth,\\nwho had concluded to run away, if he could do it safely.\\n\\nWhen we tired of the volunteers, we looked at the harbor and its\\ninanimate surroundings. A ship from Liverpool, a small steamer from\\nSavannah, and a schooner or two of the coasting class passed by us\\ntoward the city during the day, showing to what small proportions the\\ncommerce of Charleston had suddenly shrunk. On shore there seemed to be\\nno population aside from the volunteers, Sullivan\\'s Island is a summer\\nresort, much favored by Charlestonians in the hot season, because of its\\ncoolness and healthfulness, but apparently almost uninhabited in winter,\\nnotwithstanding that it boasts a village called Moultrieville. Its\\nhundred cottages are mostly of one model, square, low-roofed, a single\\nstory in height, and surrounded by a veranda, a portion of which is in\\nsome instances inclosed by blinds so as to add to the amount of shelter.\\nPaint has been sparingly used, when applied at all, and is seldom\\nrenewed, when weather-stained. The favorite colors, at least those which\\nmost strike the eye at a distance, are green and yellow. The yards are\\napt to be full of sand-drifts, which are much prized by the possessors,\\nwith whom it is an object to be secured from high tides and other\\nmore permanent aggressions of the ocean. The whole island is but a\\nverdureless sand-drift, of which the outlines are constantly changing\\nunder the influence of winds and waters. Fort Moultrie, once close to\\nthe shore, as I am told, is now a hundred yards from it; while, half\\na mile off, the sea flows over the site of a row of cottages not long\\nsince washed away. Behind Fort Moultrie, where the land rises to its\\nhighest, appears a continuous foliage of the famous palmettos, a low\\npalm, strange to the Northern eye, but not beautiful, unless to those\\nwho love it for its associations. Compared with its brothers of the\\nEast, it is short, contracted in outline, and deficient in waving grace.\\n\\nThe chill mist and drizzling rain frequently drove us under\\ncover. \"While enjoying my cigar in the little smoking-room on the\\npromenade-deck, I listened to the talk of four players of euchre, two of\\nthem Georgians, one a Carolinian, and one a pro-slavery New-Yorker.\\n\\n\"I wish the Cap\\'n would invite old Greeley on board his boat in New\\nYork,\" said the Gothamite, \"and then run him off to Charleston. I\\'d give\\nten thousand dollars towards paying expenses; that is, if they could do\\nwhat they was a mind to with him.\"\\n\\n\"I reckon a little more\\'n ten thousand dollars\\'d do it,\" grinned\\nGeorgian First.\\n\\n\"They\\'d cut him up into little bits,\" pursued the New-Yorker.\\n\\n\"They\\'d worry him first like a cat does a mouse,\" added the Carolinian.\\n\\n\"I\\'d rather serve Beecher or--what\\'s his name?--Cheever, that trick,\"\\nobserved Georgian Second. \"It\\'s the cussed parsons that\\'s done all the\\nmischief. Who played that bower? Yours, eh? My deal.\"\\n\\n\"I want to smash up some of these dam\\' Black Republicans,\" resumed the\\nNew-Yorker. \"I want to see the North suffer some. I don\\'t care, if New\\nYork catches it. I own about forty thousand dollars\\' worth of property\\nin ---- Street, and I want to see the grass growing all round it.\\nBlasted, if I can get a hand any way!\"\\n\\n\"I say, we should be in a tight place, if the forts went to firing now,\"\\nsuggested the Carolinian. \"Major Anderson would have a fair chance at\\nus, if he wanted to do us any harm.\"\\n\\n\"Damn Major Anderson!\" answered the New-Yorker. \"I\\'d shoot him myself,\\nif I had a chance. I\\'ve heard about Bob Anderson till I\\'m sick of it.\"\\n\\nOf this fashion of conversation you may hear any desired amount at the\\nSouth, by going among the right sort of people. Let us take it for\\ngranted, without making impertinent inquiry, that nothing of the kind\\nis ever uttered in any other country, whether in pot-house or parlor.\\nI suppose that such remarks seem very horrid to ladies and other\\ngentle-minded folk, who perhaps never heard the like in their lives,\\nand imagine, when they see the stuff on paper, that it is spoken with\\nscowling brows, through set teeth, and out of a heart of red-hot\\npassion. The truth is, that these ferocious phrases are generally\\ndrawled forth in an _ex-officio_ tone, as if the speaker were rather\\ntired of that sort of thing, meant nothing very particular by it, and\\ntalked thus only as a matter of fashion. It will be observed that the\\nmost violent of these politicians was a New-Yorker. I am inclined to\\npronounce, also, that the two Georgians were by birth New-Englanders.\\nThe Carolinian was the most moderate of the company, giving his\\nattention chiefly to the game, and throwing out his one remark\\nconcerning the worrying of Greeley with an air of simply civil assent\\nto the general meaning of the conversation, as an exchange of\\nanti-abolition sentiments. \"If you will play that card,\" he seemed to\\nsay, \"I follow suit as a mere matter of course.\"\\n\\nThere was a second attempt to haul us off at sunset, and a third in the\\nmorning, both unsuccessful. Each tide, though stormless, carried the\\nColumbia a little higher up the beach; and the tugs, trying singly\\nto move her, only broke their hawsers and wasted precious time.\\nFortunately, the sea continued smooth, so that the ship escaped a\\npounding. On Saturday, at eleven, twenty-eight hours after we struck,\\nall hope of getting off without discharging cargo having been abandoned,\\nwe passengers were landed on Sullivan\\'s Island, to make our way back\\nto Charleston. Our baggage was forwarded to the ferry in carts, and\\nwe followed at leisure on foot. In company with Georgian First and a\\ngentleman from Brooklyn, I strolled over the sand-rolls, damp and\\nhard now with a week\\'s rain, passed one or two of the tenantless\\nsummer-houses, and halted beside the _glacis_ of Fort Moultrie. I do not\\nwonder that Major Anderson did not consider his small force safe within\\nthis fortification. It is overlooked by neighboring sand-hills and by\\nthe houses of Moultrieville, which closely surround it on the land side,\\nwhile its ditch is so narrow and its rampart so low that a ladder of\\ntwenty-five feet in length would reach from the outside of the former to\\nthe summit of the latter. A fire of sharp-shooters from the commanding\\npoints, and two columns of attack, would have crushed the feeble\\ngarrison. No military movement could be more natural than the retreat to\\nFort Sumter. What puzzles one, especially on the spot, and what nobody\\nin Charleston could explain to me, is the fact that this manoeuvre could\\nbe executed unobserved by the people of Moultrieville, few as they are,\\nand by the guard-boats which patrolled the harbor.\\n\\nOn the eastern side of the fort two or three dozen <DW64>s were engaged\\nin filling canvas bags with sand, to be used in forming temporary\\nembrasures. One lad of eighteen, a dark mulatto, presented the very\\nremarkable peculiarity of chest-nut hair, only slightly curling. The\\nothers were nearly all of the true field-hand type, aboriginal black,\\nwith dull faces, short and thick forms, and an air of animal contentment\\nor at least indifference. They talked little, but giggled a great deal,\\nsnatching the canvas bags from each other, and otherwise showing their\\ndisbelief in the doctrine of all work and no play. When the barrows were\\nsufficiently filled to suit their weak ideal of a load, a procession of\\nthem set off along a plank causeway leading into the fort, observing a\\ndroll semblance of military precision and pomp, and forcing a passage\\nthrough lounging unmilitary buckras with an air of, \"Out of de way, Ole\\nDan Tucker!\" We glanced at the yet unfinished ditch, half full of water,\\nand walked on to the gateway. A grinning, skipping <DW64> drummer was\\nshowing a new pair of shoes to the tobacco-chewing, jovial youth who\\nstood, or rather sat, sentinel.\\n\\n\"How\\'d you get hold of _them?_\" asked the latter, surveying the articles\\nadmiringly.\\n\\n\"Got a special order frum the Cap\\'m fur \\'um. That ee way to do it. Won\\'t\\nwet through, no matter how it rain. He, he! I\\'m all right now.\"\\n\\nHere he showed ivory to his ears, cut a caper, and danced into the fort.\\n\\n\"D-a-m\\' nig-ger!\" grinned the sentinel, approvingly, looking at us to\\nsee if we also enjoyed the incident. Thus introduced to the temporary\\nguardian of the fort, we told him that we were from the Columbia, which\\nhe was glad to bear of, wanting to know if she was damaged, how she went\\nashore, whether she could get off, etc., etc. He was a fair specimen of\\nthe average country Southerner, lounging, open to address, and fond of\\ntalk.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve no authority to let you in,\" he said, when we asked that favor;\\n\"but I\\'ll call the corporal of the guard.\"\\n\\n\"If you please.\"\\n\\n\"Corporal of the guard!\"\\n\\nAppeared the corporal, who civilly heard us, and went for the lieutenant\\nof the guard. Presently a blonde young officer, with a pleasant face,\\nsomewhat Irish in character, came out to us, raising his forefinger in\\nmilitary salute.\\n\\n\"We should like to go into the fort, if it is proper,\" I said. \"We ask\\nhospitality the more boldly, because we are shipwrecked people.\"\\n\\n\"It is against the regulations. However, I venture to take the\\nresponsibility,\" was the obliging answer.\\n\\nWe passed in, and wandered unwatched for half an hour about the\\nirregular, many-angled fortress. One-third of the interior is occupied\\nby two brick barracks, covered with rusty stucco, and by other brick\\nbuildings, as yet incomplete, which I took to be of the nature of\\nmagazines. On the walls, gaping landward as well as seaward, are thirty\\nor thirty-five iron cannon, all _en barbette_, but protected toward the\\nharbor by heavy piles of sand-bags, fenced up either with barrels of\\nsand or palmetto-logs driven firmly into the rampart. Four eight-inch\\ncolumbiads, carrying sixty-four pound balls, pointed at Fort Sumter. Six\\nother heavy pieces, Paixhans, I believe, faced the neck of the harbor.\\nThe remaining armament of lighter calibre, running, I should judge, from\\nforty-twos down to eighteens. Only one gun lay on the ground destitute\\nof a carriage. The place will stand a great deal of battering; for the\\nwalls are nearly bidden by the sand-covered _glacis_, which would catch\\nand smother four point-blank shots out of five, if discharged from a\\ndistance. Against shells, however, it has no resource; and one mortar\\nwould make it a most unwholesome residence.\\n\\n\"What\\'s this?\" asked a volunteer, in homespun gray uniform, who, like\\nourselves, had come in by courtesy.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the butt of the old flag-staff,\" answered a comrade. \"Cap\\'n\\nFoster cut it down before he left the fort, damn him I It was a dam\\'\\nsneaking trick. I\\'ve a great mind to shave off a sliver and send it to\\nLincoln.\"\\n\\nThe idea of getting a bit of the famous staff as a memento struck\\nme, and I attempted to put it in practice; but the exceedingly tough\\npitch-pine defied my slender pocket-knife.\\n\\n\"Jim, cut the gentleman a piece,\" said one of the volunteers, Jim drew a\\ntoothpick a foot long and did me the favor, for which I here repeat my\\nthanks to him.\\n\\nThey were good-looking, healthy fellows, these two, like most of their\\ncomrades, with a certain air of frank gentility and self-respect about\\nthem, being probably the sons of well-to-do planters. It would be a\\ngreat mistake to suppose that the volunteers are drawn, to any extent\\nwhatever, from the \"poor white trash.\" The secession movement, like all\\nthe political action of the State at all times, is independent of the\\ncrackers, asks no aid nor advice of them, and, in short, ignores them\\nutterly.\\n\\n\"I was here when the Star of the West was fired on,\" the Lieutenant told\\nus. \"We only had powder for two hours. Anderson could have put us out in\\na short time, if he had chosen.\"\\n\\n\"How rapidly can these heavy guns be fired?\"\\n\\n\"About ten times an hour.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think the defences will protect the garrison against a\\nbombardment?\"\\n\\n\"I think the palmetto stockades will answer. I don\\'t know about that\\nenormous pile of barrels, however. If a shot hits the mass on the top, I\\nam afraid it will come down, bags and barrels together, bury the gun and\\nperhaps the gunners.\"\\n\\n\"What if Sumter should open now?\" I suggested.\\n\\n\"We should be here to help,\" answered the Georgian.\\n\\n\"We should be here to run away,\" amended my comrade from Brooklyn.\\n\\n\"Well, I suppose we should be of mighty little use, and might as well\\nclear out,\" was the sober second-thought of the Georgian.\\n\\nHaving satisfied our curiosity, we thanked the Lieutenant and left Fort\\nMoultrie. The story of our visit to it excited much surprise, when we\\nrecounted it in the city. Members of the Legislature and other men high\\nin influence had desired the privilege, but had not applied for it,\\nexpecting a repulse.\\n\\nA walk down a winding street, bordered by scattered cottages, inclosed\\nby brown board-fences or railings, and tracked by a horse-railroad built\\nfor the Moultrie House, led us to the ferry-wharf, where we found our\\nbaggage piled together, and our fellow-passengers wandering about in a\\nstate of bored expectation. Sullivan\\'s Island in winter is a good spot\\nfor an economical man, inasmuch as it presents no visible opportunities\\nof spending money. There were houses of refreshment, as we could see\\nby their signs; but if they did business, it was with closed doors\\nand barred shutters. After we had paid a newsboy five cents for the\\n\"Mercury,\" and five more for the \"Courier,\" we were at the end of our\\npossibilities in the way of extravagance. At half-past one arrived the\\nferry-boat with a few passengers, mostly volunteers, and a deck-load of\\nmilitary stores, among which I noticed Boston biscuit and several dozen\\nnew knapsacks. Then, from the other side, came the \"dam\\' <DW65>,\" that\\nis to say, the drummer of the new shoes, beating his sheepskin at the\\nhead of about fifty men of the Washington Artillery, who were on their\\nway back to town from Fort Moultrie. They were fine-looking young\\nfellows, mostly above the middle size of Northerners, with spirited and\\noften aristocratic faces, but somewhat more devil-may-care in expression\\nthan we are accustomed to see in New England. They poured down the\\ngangway, trailed arms, ascended the promenade-deck, ordered arms,\\ngrounded arms, and broke line. The drill struck me as middling, which\\nmay be owing to the fact that the company has lately increased to about\\ntwo hundred members, thus diluting the old organization with a large\\nnumber of new recruits. Military service at the South is a patrician\\nexercise, much favored by men of \"good family,\" more especially at this\\ntime, when it signifies real danger and glory.\\n\\nOur rajpoots having entered the boat, we of lower caste were permitted\\nto follow. At two o\\'clock we were steaming over the yellow waters of the\\nharbor. The volunteers, like everybody else in Charleston, discussed\\nSecession and Fort Sumter, considering the former as an accomplished\\nfact, and the latter as a fact of the kind called stubborn. They talked\\nuniform, too, and equipments, and marksmanship, and drinks, and cigars,\\nand other military matters. Now and then an awkwardly folded blanket was\\ntaken from the shoulders which it disgraced, refolded, packed carefully\\nin its covering of India-rubber, and strapped once more in its place,\\ntwo or three generally assisting in the operation. Presently a firing at\\nmarks from the upper deck commenced. The favorite target was a conical\\nfloating buoy, showing red on the sunlit surface of the harbor, some\\nfour hundred yards away. With a crack and a hoarse whiz the minie-balls\\nflew towards it, splashing up the water where they first struck and then\\ntaking two or three tremendous skips before they sank. A militiaman from\\nNew York city, who was one of my fellow-passengers, told me that he\\n\"never saw such good shooting.\" It seemed to me that every sixth ball\\neither hit the buoy full, or touched water but a few yards this side of\\nit, while not more than one in a dozen went wild.\\n\\n\"It is good for a thousand yards,\" said a volunteer, slapping his\\nbright, new piece, proudly.\\n\\nA favorite subject of argument appeared to be whether Fort Sumter ought\\nto be attacked immediately or not. A lieutenant standing near me talked\\nlong and earnestly regarding this matter with a civilian friend,\\nbreaking out at last in a loud tone,--\\n\\n\"Why, good Heaven, Jim! do you want that place to go peaceably into the\\nhands of Lincoln?\"\\n\\n\"No, Fred, I do not. But I tell you, Fred, when that fort is attacked,\\nit will be the bloodiest day,--the bloodiest day!--the bloodiest----!!\"\\n\\nAnd here, unable to express himself in words, Jim flung his arms wildly\\nabout, ground his tobacco with excitement, spit on all sides, and walked\\naway, shaking his head, I thought, in real grief of spirit.\\n\\nWe passed close to Fort Pinckney, our volunteers exchanging hurrahs with\\nthe garrison. It is a round, two-storied, yellow little fortification,\\nstanding at one end of a green marsh known as Shute\\'s Folly Island.\\nWhat it was put there for no one knows: it is too close to the city to\\nprotect it; too much out of the harbor to command that. Perhaps it might\\nkeep reinforcements for Anderson from coming down the Ashley, just as\\nthe guns on the Battery were supposed to be intended to deter them from\\ndescending the Cooper.\\n\\nOn the wharf of the ferry three drunken volunteers, the first that I had\\nseen in that condition, brushed against me. The nearest one, a handsome\\nyoung fellow of six feet two, half turned to stare back at me with a--\\n\\n\"How are ye, Cap\\'m? Gaw damn ye! Haw, haw, aw!\"--and reeled onward,\\nbrimful of spirituous good-nature.\\n\\nFour days more had I in Charleston, waiting from tide to tide for a\\nchance to sail to New York, and listening from hour to hour for the guns\\nof Fort Sumter. Sunday was a day of excitement, a report spreading that\\nthe Floridians had attacked Fort Pickens, and the Charlestonians feeling\\nconsequently bound in honor to fight their own dragon. Groups of earnest\\nmen talked all day and late into the evening under the portico and in\\nthe basement-rooms of the hotel, besides gathering at the corners and\\nstrolling about the Battery. \"We must act.\" \"We cannot delay.\" \"We ought\\nnot to submit.\" Such were the phrases that fell upon the ear oftenest\\nand loudest.\\n\\nAs I lounged, after tea, in the vestibule of the reading-room, an\\neccentric citizen of Arkansas varied the entertainment. A short, thin\\nman, of the cracker type, swarthy, long-bearded, and untidy, he was\\ndressed in well-worn civilian costume, with the exception of an old\\nblue coat showing dim remnants of military garniture. Heeling up to a\\ngentleman who sat near me, he glared stupidly at him from beneath a\\nbroad-brimmed hat, demanding a seat mutely, but with such eloquence of\\noscillation that no words were necessary. The respectable person thus\\naddressed, not anxious to receive the stranger into his lap, rose and\\nwalked away, with that air of not, having seen anything so common to\\ndisconcerted people who wish to conceal their disturbance. Into the\\nvacant place dropped the stranger, stretching out his feet, throwing\\nhis head back against the wall, and half closing his eyes with the\\ndrunkard\\'s own leer of self-sufficiency. During a few moments of\\nagonizing suspense the world waited. Then from those whiskey-scorched\\nand tobacco-stained lips came a long, shrill \"Yee-p!\"\\n\\nIt was his exordium; it demanded the attention of the company; and\\nthough he had it not, he continued:--\\n\\n\"I\\'m an Arkansas man, _I_ am. I\\'m a big su-gar planter, _I_ am. All\\nright! Go a\\'ead! I own fifty <DW65>s, _I_ do. Yee-p!\"\\n\\nHe lifted both feet and slammed them on the floor energetically, pausing\\nfor a reply. He had addressed all men; no one responded, and he went\\non:--\\n\\n\"I\\'m for straightout, immedit shession, _I_ am. I go for \\'staining\\ncoursh of Sou\\' Car\\'lina, _I_ do. I\\'m ready to fight for Sou\\' Car\\'lina.\\nI\\'m a Na-po-le-on Bonaparte. All right! Go a\\'ead! Yee-p! Fellahs don\\'t\\nknow me here. I\\'m an Arkansas man, I am. Sou\\' Car\\'lina won\\'t kill an\\nArkansas man. I\\'m an immedit shessionist. Hurrah for Sou\\' Car\\'lina! All\\nright! Yee-p!\"\\n\\nThere was a lingering, caressing accent on his \"_I_ am,\" which told how\\ndear to him was his individuality, drunk or sober. He looked at no one;\\nhis hat was drawn over his eyes; his hands were deep in his pockets;\\nhis feet did all needful gesturing. I stepped in front of him to get\\na fuller view of his face, and the action aroused his attention. He\\nsurveyed my gray Inverness wrapper and gave me a chuckling nod of\\napprobation.\\n\\n\"How are ye, Bub? I like that blanket, _I_ do.\"\\n\\nIn spite of this noble stranger\\'s goodwill and prowess, we still found\\nFort Sumter a knotty question. In a country which for eighty years has\\nnot seen a shot fired in earnest, it is not wonderful that a good\\ndeal of ignorance should exist concerning military matters, and\\nthat second-class plans should be hatched for taking a first-class\\nfortification. While I was in Charleston, the most popular proposition\\nwas to bombard continuously for two whole days and nights, thereby\\ndemoralizing the garrison by depriving it of sleep and causing it to\\nsurrender at the first attempt to escalade. Another plan, not in general\\nfavor, was to smoke Anderson out by means of a raft covered with burning\\nmixtures of a chemical and bad-smelling nature. Still another, with\\nperhaps yet fewer adherents, was to advance on all sides in such a vast\\nnumber of row-boats that the fort could not sink them all, whereupon\\nthe survivors should land on the wharf and proceed to take such further\\nmeasures as might be deemed expedient. The volunteers from the country\\nalways arrived full of faith and defiance. \"We want to get a squint at\\nthat Fort Sumter,\" they would say to their city friends. \"We are going\\nto take it. If we don\\'t plant the palmetto on it, it\\'s because there\\'s\\nno such tree as the palmetto.\" Down the harbor they would go in the\\nferry-boats to Morris or Sullivan\\'s Island. The spy-glass would be\\nbrought out, and one after another would peer through it at the object\\nof their enmity. Some could not sight it at all, confounded the\\ninstrument, and fell back on their natural vision. Others, more lucky,\\nor better versed in telescopic observations, got a view of the fortress,\\nand perhaps burst out swearing at the evident massiveness of the walls\\nand the size of the columbiads.\\n\\n\"Good Lord, what a gun!\" exclaimed one man. \"D\\'ye see that gun? What an\\nalmighty thing! I\\'ll be ----, if I ever put my head in front of it!\"\\n\\nThe difficulties of assault were admitted to be very great, considering\\nthe bad footing, the height of the ramparts, and the abundant store of\\nmuskets and grenades in the garrison. As to breaches, nobody seemed to\\nknow whether they could be made or not. The besieging batteries were\\nneither heavy nor near, nor could they be advanced as is usual in\\nregular sieges, nor had they any advantage over the defence except in\\nthe number of gunners, while in regard to position and calibre they were\\ninferior. To knock down a wall nearly forty feet high and fourteen feet\\nthick at a distance of more than half a mile seemed a tough undertaking,\\neven when unresisted. It was discovered also that the side of the\\nfortification towards Fort Johnstone, its only weak point, had been\\nstrengthened so as to make it bomb-proof by means of interior masonry\\nconstructed from the stones of the landing-place. Then nobody wanted to\\nknock Fort Sumter down, inasmuch as that involved either the labor\\nof building it up again, or the necessity of going without it as a\\nharbor-defence. Finally, suppose it should be attacked and not taken?\\nReally, we unlearned people in the art of war were vastly puzzled as we\\nthought tins whole matter over, and we sometimes doubted whether our\\nsuperiors were not almost equally bothered with ourselves.\\n\\nThis fighting was a sober, sad subject; and yet at times it took a turn\\ntoward the ludicrous. A gentleman told me that he was present when the\\nsteamer Marion was seized with the intention of using her in pursuing\\nthe Star of the West. A vehement dispute arose as to the fitness of the\\nvessel for military service.\\n\\n\"Fill her with men, and put two or three eighteen-pounders in her,\" said\\nthe advocates of the measure.\\n\\n\"Where will you put your eighteen-pounders?\" demanded the opposition.\\n\\n\"On the promenade-deck, to be sure.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and the moment you fire one, you\\'ll see it go through the bottom\\nof the ship, and then you\\'ll have to go after it.\"\\n\\nDuring the two days previous to my second and successful attempt to quit\\nCharleston, the city was in full expectation that the fort would shortly\\nbe attacked. News had arrived that Federal troops were on their way with\\nreinforcements. An armed steamer had been seen off the harbor, both by\\nnight and day, making signals to Anderson. The Governor went down\\nto Sullivan\\'s Island to inspect the troops and Fort Moultrie. The\\nvolunteers, aided by <DW64>s and even <DW64> women, worked all night on\\nthe batteries. Notwithstanding we were close upon race-week, when the\\ncity is usually crowded, the streets had a deserted air, and nearly\\nevery acquaintance I met told me he had been down to the islands to\\nsee the preparations. Yet the whole excitement, like others which had\\npreceded, ended even short of smoke. News came that reinforcements had\\nnot been sent to Anderson; and the destruction of that most inconvenient\\nperson was once more postponed. People fell back on the old hope that\\nthe Government would be brought to listen to reason,--that it would\\ngive up to South Carolina what it could not keep from her with justice,\\n--that it would grant, in short, the incontrovertible right of peaceable\\nsecession. For, in the midst of all these labors and terrors, this\\nexpense and annoyance, no one talked of returning into the Union, and\\nall agreed in deprecating compromise.\\n\\nOnce more, this time in the James Adger, I set sail from Charleston. The\\nboat lost one tide, and consequently one day, because at the last\\nmoment the captain found himself obliged to take out a South Carolina\\nclearance. As I passed down the harbor, I counted fourteen square-rigged\\nvessels at the wharves, and one lying at anchor, while three others had\\njust passed the bar, outward-bound, and two were approaching from the\\nopen sea. Deterred from the Ship Channel by the sunken schooners, and\\nfrom Maffitt\\'s Channel by the fate of the Columbia, we tried the Middle\\nChannel, and glided over the bar without accident.\\n\\n\"Sailing to Charleston is very much like going foreign,\" I said to a\\nmiddle-aged sea-captain whom we numbered among our passengers. \"What\\nwith heaving the lead, and doing without beacons, and lying off the\\ncoast o\\' nights, it makes one think of trading to new countries.\"\\n\\nI had, it seems, unintentionally pulled the string which jerked him.\\nSpringing up, he paced about excitedly for a few moments, and then broke\\nout with his story.\\n\\n\"Yes,--I know it,--I know as much about it as anybody, I reckon. I lay\\noff there nine days in a nor\\'easter and lost my anchors; and here I am\\ngoing on to New York to buy some more; and all for those cursed Black\\nRepublicans!\"\\n\\nIn South Carolina they see but one side of the shield,--which is quite\\ndifferent, as we know, from the custom of the rest of mankind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nREVIEWS AND LITERARY NOTICES.\\n\\n\\n1. _Descriptive Ethnology._ By R.G. LATHAM. 2 vols. London. 1859.\\n\\n2. _Anthropologie der Naturvoelker._ Von Dr. T. WAIZ. 2 Baender. Leipzig.\\n1860.\\n\\nSome writers have the remarkable faculty of making the subject which\\nthey may happen to treat forever more distasteful and wearisome to their\\nreaders. Whether the cause be in the style, or the point of view, or\\nthe method of treatment, or in all together, they seem able to force the\\nstudent away in disgust from the whole field on which they labor, with\\nvows never again to cross it.\\n\\nSuch an author, it seems to us, is pre-eminently R.G. Latham, in his\\ntreatment of Ethnology. Happy the man who has any such philosophic\\ninterest in Human Races, that he can ever care to hear again of the\\nsubject, after perusing Mr. Latham\\'s various volumes on \"Descriptive\\nEthnology.\" We wonder that the whole English reading public; has not\\nconsigned the science to the shelf of Encyclopedias of Useful Knowledge,\\nor of Year-Books of Fact, or any other equally philosophic and connected\\nworks, after the treatment which this modern master of Ethnology has\\ngiven to the subject.\\n\\nSuch disconnected masses of facts are heaped together in these works,\\nsuch incredible dulness is shown in presenting them, such careful\\navoidance of any generalization or of any interesting particular, such\\na bald and conceited style, and such a cockneyish and self-opinionated\\nview of human history, as our soul wearies even to think of. Mr. Latham\\ndisdains any link of philosophy, or any classification, among his \"ten\\nthousand facts,\" as being a fault of the \"German School\" (whatever that\\nmay be) of Ethnology. It seems to him soundly \"British\" to disbelieve\\nall the best conclusions of modern scholarship, and to urge his own\\nfanciful or shallow theories. He treats all human superstitions and\\nmythologies as if he were standing in the Strand and judging them by the\\nideas of modern London. His is a Cockney\\'s view of antiquity. He cannot\\nimagine that a barbarous and infant people, groping in the mysteries of\\nthe moral universe, might entertain some earnest and poetic views which\\nwere not precisely in the line of thought of the Londoners of the\\nnineteenth century, and yet which might be worth investigating. To his\\nmind, there is no grand march of humanity, slow, but certain, towards\\nhigher ideals, through the various lines of race,--but rather\\ninnumerable ripples on the surface of history, which come and pass away\\nwithout connection and without purpose.\\n\\nThe reader wades slowly through his books, and leaves them with a\\nfeeling of intense disgust. Such a vast gathering of facts merely to\\nproduce this melancholy confusion of details! You feel that his eminence\\nin the science must be from the circumstance that no one else is dull\\nenough and patient enough to gather such a museum of facts in regard\\nto human beings. The mind is utterly confused as to divisions of human\\nraces, and is ready to conclude that there must be almost as many\\nvarieties of man as there are tribes or dialects, and that Ethnology has\\nnot yet reached the position of a science.\\n\\nThe reader must pardon the bitterness of our feelings; but we are just\\nsmarting from a prolonged perusal of all Mr. Latham\\'s works, especially\\nthe two volumes whose title is given above; and that we may have\\nsympathy, if only in a faint degree, from our friends, we quote a few\\npassages, taken at random, though we cannot possibly thus convey an\\nadequate conception of the infinite dulness of the work.\\n\\nThe following is his elegant introduction:--\\n\\n  \"I follow the Horatian rule, and plunge, at\\n  once, _in medias res_. I am on the Indus, but\\n  not on the Indian portion of it. I am on the\\n  Himalayas, but not on their southern side. I\\n  am on the northwestern ranges, with Tartary\\n  on the north, Bokhara on the west, and Hindostan\\n  on the south. I am in a neighborhood\\n  where three great religions meet: Mahometanism,\\n  Buddhism. Brahminism. I _must_ begin\\n  somewhere; and here is my beginning.\"--\\n  Vol. i. p. 1.\\n\\nThe following is his analysis of the beautiful Finnish Kalevala:--\\n\\n\"Wainamoinen is much of a smith, and more of a harper. Illmarinen is\\nmost of a smith. Lemminkainen is much of a harper, and little of a\\nsmith. The hand of the daughter of the mistress of Pohjola is what, each\\nand all, the three sons of Kalevala strive to win,--a hand which the\\nmother of the owner will give to any one who can make for her and\\nfor Pohjola _Sampo_, Wainamoinen will not; but he knows of one who\\nwill,--Illmarinen. Illmarinen makes it, and gains the mother\\'s consent\\nthereby. But the daughter requires another service. He must hunt down\\nthe elk of Tunela. We now see the way in which the actions of the heroes\\nare, at one and the same time, separate and connected. Wainamoinen\\ntries; Illmarinen tries (and eventually wins); Lemminkainen tries. There\\nare alternations of friendship and enmity. Sampo is made and presented.\\nIt is then wanted back again.\\n\\n\"\\'Give us,\\' says Wainamoinen, \\'if not the whole, half.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Sampo,\\' says Louki, the mistress of Pohjola,\\' cannot be divided.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Then let us steal it,\\' says one of the three.\\n\\n\"\\'Agreed,\\' say the other two.\\n\\n\"So the rape of Sampo takes place. It is taken from Pohjola, whilst the\\nowners are sung to sleep by the harp of Lemminkainen; sung to sleep,\\nbut not for so long a time as to allow the robbers to escape. They are\\nsailing Kalevalaward, when Louki comes after them on the wings of the\\nwind, and raises a storm. Sampo is broken, and thrown into the sea. Bad\\ndays now come. There is no sun, no moon. Illmarinen makes them of silver\\nand gold. He had previously made his second wife (for he lost his first)\\nout of the same metals. However, Sampo is washed up, and made whole.\\nGood days come. The sun and moon shine as before, and the sons of\\nKalevala possess Sampo.\"--Vol. i., pp. 433, 434.\\n\\nThis, again, is Mr. Latham\\'s profound and interesting view of\\n_Buddhism:--_\\n\\n\"Buddhism is one thing. Practices out of which Buddhism may be developed\\nare another. It has been already suggested that the ideas conveyed by\\nthe terms _Sramanoe_ and _Gymnosophistoe_ are just as Brahminic as\\nBuddhist, and, _vice versa_, just as Buddhist as Brahminic.\\n\\n\"The earliest dates of specific Buddhism are of the same age as the\\nearliest dates of specific Brahminism.\\n\\n\"Clemens of Alexandria mentions Buddhist pyramids, the Buddhist habit of\\ndepositing certain bones in them, the Buddhist practice of foretelling\\nevents, the Buddhist practice of continence, the Buddhist Semnai or holy\\nvirgins. This, however, may he but so much asceticism. He mentions this\\nand more. He supplies the name Bouta; Bouta being honored as a god.\\n\\n\"From Cyril of Jerusalem we learn that Samnaism was, more or less,\\nManichaean,--Manichaeanism being, more or less, Samanist. Terebinthus,\\nthe preceptor of Manes, took the name Baudas. In Epiphanius, Terebinthus\\nis the pupil of Scythianus.\\n\\n\"Suidas makes Terebinthus a pupil of Baudda, who pretended to be the\\nson of a virgin. And here we may stop to remark, that the Mongol\\nTshingiz-Khan is said to be virgin-born; that, word for word, Scythianus\\nis Sak; that Sakya Muni (compare it with Manes) is a name of Buddha.\\n\\n\"Be this as it may, there was, before A.D. 300,--\\n\\n  \"1. Action and reaction between Buddhism\\n  and Christianity.\\n\\n  \"2. Buddhist buildings.\\n\\n  \"3. The same cultus in both Bactria and\\n  India.\\n\\n  \"Whether this constitute Buddhism is another\\n  question.\"--Vol. ii. p. 317.\\n\\nAnd more of an equally attractive and comprehensible character.\\n\\nWe assure the reader that these extracts are but feeble exponents of the\\npeculiar power of Mr. Latham\\'s works,--a power of unmitigated dulness.\\nWhat his views are on the great questions of the science--the origin\\nof races, the migrations, the crossings of varieties, and the like--no\\nmortal can remember, who has penetrated the labyrinth of his researches.\\n\\nAn author of a very different kind is Professor Waiz, whose work on\\nAnthropology has just reached this country: a writer as philosophic as\\nMr. Latham is disconnected; as pleasing and natural in style as the\\nother is affected; as simply open to the true and good in all customs or\\nsuperstitions of barbarous peoples as the Englishman is contemptuous of\\neverything not modern and European. Waiz seems to us the most careful\\nand truly scientific author in the field of Ethnology whom we have\\nhad since Prichard, and with the wider scope which belongs to the\\nintellectual German.\\n\\nThe bane of this science, as every one knows, has been its theorizing,\\nand its want of careful inductive reasoning from facts. The\\nclassifications in it have been endless, varying almost with the fancies\\nof each new student; while every prominent follower of it has had some\\npet hypothesis, to which he desired to suit his facts. Whether the\\n_a priori_ theory were of modern miraculous origin or of gradual\\ndevelopment, of unity or of diversity of parentage, of permanent and\\nabsolute divisions of races or of a community of blood, it has equally\\nforced the author to twist his facts.\\n\\nPerhaps the basest of all uses to which theory has been put in this\\nscience was in a well-known American work, where facts and fancies in\\nEthnology were industriously woven together to form another withe about\\nthe limbs of the wretched African slave.\\n\\nWaiz has reasoned slowly and carefully from facts, considering in\\nhis view all possible hypotheses,--even, for instance, the\\ndevelopment-theory of Darwin,--and has formed his own conclusion on\\nscientific data, or has wisely avowed that no conclusion is possible.\\n\\nThe classification to which he is forced is that which all profound\\ninvestigators are approaching,--that of language interpreted by history.\\nHe is compelled to believe that no physiological evidences of race can\\nbe considered as at all equal to the evidences from language. At the\\nsame time, he is ready to admit that even this classification is\\nimperfect, as from the nature of the case it must be; for the source of\\nthe confusion lies in the very unity of mankind. He rejects _in toto_\\nProfessor Agassiz\\'s \"realm-theory,\" as inconsistent with facts. The\\nhybrid-question, as put by Messrs. Gliddon and Nott, meets with a\\nsearching and careful investigation, with the conclusion that nothing\\nin facts yet ascertained proves any want of vitality or power of\\npropagation in mulattoes or in crosses of any human races.\\n\\nThe unity of origin and the vast antiquity of mankind are the two\\nimportant conclusions drawn.\\n\\nHis second volume is entirely devoted to the <DW64> races, and is the\\nmost valuable treatise yet written on that topic.\\n\\nThe whole work is mainly directed towards _Naturvoelker_, or \"Peoples in\\na State of Nature,\" and therefore cannot be recommended for translation,\\nas a general text-book on the science of Ethnology,--a book which is\\nnow exceedingly needed in all our higher schools and colleges; but as\\na general treatise, with many new and important facts, scientifically\\ntreated, it can be most highly commended to the general scholar.\\n\\n\\n_Il Politecnico. Repertorio Mensile di Studi applicati alia Prosperita e\\nColtura Sociale._ Milano, 1860. New York: Charles B. Norton, Agent for\\nLibraries, 596, Broadway.\\n\\nAmong the best first-fruits of Italian liberty are the free publication\\nand circulation of books; and it is a striking indication of the new\\norder of things in Lombardy, that the publishers at Milan of the monthly\\njournal, \"Il Politecnico,\" should at once have established an American\\nagency in New York, and that in successive numbers of their periodical\\nduring the present year they should have furnished lists of some of the\\nprincipal American publications which they are prepared to obtain for\\nItalian readers. It will be a fortunate circumstance for the people of\\nboth countries, should a ready means be established for the interchange\\nof their contemporaneous works in literature and science.\\n\\nThe \"Politecnico\" is not altogether a new journal. Seven volumes of it\\nbad been published, and had acquired for it a high reputation and a\\nconsiderable circulation, when political events put a stop to its\\nissue. The Austrian system of government after 1849 repressed alt free\\nexpression of thought in Lombardy; and no encouragement was afforded for\\nthe publication of any work not under the control of the administration.\\nWith the beginning of the present year the \"Politecnico\" was\\nreestablished, mainly through the influence and under the direction of\\nDr. Carlo Cattaneo, who had been the chief promoter of the preceding\\noriginal series. The numbers of the new series give evidence of talent\\nand independence in its conductors and contributors, and contain\\narticles of intrinsic value, beside that which they possess as\\nindications of the present intellectual condition and tendencies of\\nItaly. The journal is wholly devoted to serious studies, its object\\nbeing the cultivation of the moral and physical sciences with the arts\\ndepending on them, and their practical application to promote the\\nnational prosperity. That it will carry out its design with ability is\\nguarantied by the character of Cattaneo.\\n\\nCarlo Cattaneo is a man of unquestioned power of intellect, of strong\\ncharacter, and resolute energy. Already distinguished, not only as a\\npolitical economist, but as a forcible reasoner in applied politics, he\\ntook a leading part in the struggle of 1848 in Milan, and, inspired by\\nill-will towards Charles Albert and the Piedmontese, was one of the\\npromoters of the disastrous Lombard policy which defeated the hopes of\\nthe opponents of Austria at that day. Though an Italian liberal, and\\nunquestionably honest in his patriotic intentions, he was virtually an\\nally of Radetzky. When the Austrians retook Milan, he was compelled to\\nfly, and took refuge in Lugano, where he compiled three large volumes\\non the affairs of Italy, from the accession of Pius IX. to the fall of\\nVenice, in which he exhibited his political views, endeavoring to show\\nthat the misfortunes of Lombardy were due to the ambitious and false\\npolicy of the unhappy Charles Albert. His distrust of the Piedmontese\\nhas not diminished with the recent changes in the affairs of Italy; and\\nalthough Lombardy is now united to Piedmont, and the hope of freedom\\nseems to lie in a hearty and generous union of men of all parties in\\nsupport of the new government, Cattaneo, when in March last he was\\nelected a member of the National Parliament, refused to take his seat,\\nthat he might not be obliged to swear allegiance to the King and the\\nConstitution. His political desire seems to be to see Italy not brought\\nunder one rule, but composed of a union of states, each preserving\\nits special autonomy. He is a federalist, and does not share in the\\nunitarian view which prevails with almost all the other prominent\\nItalian statesmen, and which at this moment appears to be the only\\nsystem that can create a strong, united, independent Italy. It was to\\nhim, perhaps, more than to any other single man, that the difficulties\\nwhich lately arose in the settling of the mode of annexation of Sicily\\nand Naples to the Sardinian kingdom were due; and the small party in\\nParliament which recently refused to join in the vote of confidence in\\nthe ministry of Cavour was led by Ferrari, the disciple of the Milanese\\nDoctor.\\n\\nBut however impracticable Cattaneo may be, and however mistaken and\\nextravagant his political views, he is a man of such vigor of mind, that\\na journal conducted by him becomes, from the fact of his connection with\\nit, one of the important organs of Italian thought. We trust that the\\n\"Politecnico\" will find subscribers among those in our country who\\ndesire to keep up their knowledge of Italian affairs at a time of such\\nextraordinary interest as the present.\\n\\n\\n_Elsie Venner_. A Romance of Destiny. By OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES. 2 vols.\\nBoston: Ticknor & Fields. 1861.\\n\\nEnglish literature numbers among its more or less distinguished authors\\na goodly number of physicians. Sir Thomas Browne was, perhaps, the\\nlast of the great writers of English prose whose mind and style were\\nimpregnated with imagination. He wrote poetry without meaning it, as\\nmany of his brother doctors have meant to write poetry without doing it,\\nin the classic style of\\n\\n  \"Inoculation, heavenly maid, descend!\"\\n\\nGarth\\'s \"Dispensary\" was long ago as fairly buried as any of his\\npatients; and Armstrong\\'s \"Health\" enjoys the dreary immortality of\\nbeing preserved in the collections, like one of those queer things they\\nshow you in a glass jar at the anatomical museums. Arbuthnot, a truly\\ngenial humorist, has hardly had justice done him. People laugh over his\\nfun in the \"Memoirs of Scriblerus,\" and are commonly satisfied to think\\nit Pope\\'s. Smollett insured his literary life in \"Humphrey Clinker\";\\nand we suppose his Continuation of Hume is still one of the pills which\\ningenuous youth is expected to gulp before it is strong enough to\\nresist. Goldsmith\\'s fame has steadily gained; and so has that of Keats,\\nwhom we may also fairly reckon in our list, though he remained harmless,\\nhaving never taken a degree. On the whole, the proportion of doctors who\\nhave positively succeeded in our literature is a large one, and we\\nhave now another very marked and beautiful case in Dr. Holmes. Since\\nArbuthnot, the profession has produced no such wit; since Goldsmith, no\\nauthor so successful.\\n\\nFive years ago it would have been only Dr. Holmes\\'s intimate friends\\nthat would have considered the remarkable success he has achieved not\\nonly possible, but probable. They knew, that, if the fitting opportunity\\nshould only come, he would soon show how much stuff he had in\\nhim,--sterner stuff, too, than the world had supposed,--stuff not\\nmerely to show off the iris of a brilliant reputation, but to block out\\ninto the foundations of an enduring fame. It seems an odd thing to say\\nthat Dr. Holmes had suffered by having given proof of too much wit; but\\nit is undoubtedly true. People in general have a great respect for those\\nwho scare them or make them cry, but are apt to weigh lightly one who\\namuses them. They like to be tickled, but they would hardly take the\\nadvice of their tickler on any question they thought serious. We have\\nour doubts whether the majority of those who make up what is called \"the\\nworld\" are fond of wit. It rather puts them out, as Nature did Fuseli:\\nThey look on its crinkling play as men do at lightning; and while they\\ngrant it is very fine, are teased with an uncomfortable wonder as to\\nwhere it is going to strike next. They would rather, on the whole,\\nit were farther off. They like well-established jokes, the fine old\\nsmoked-herring sort, such as the clown offers them in the circus,\\nwarranted never to spoil, if only kept dry enough. Your fresh wit\\ndemands a little thought, perhaps, or at least a kind of negative wit,\\nin the recipient. It is an active, meddlesome--quality, forever putting\\nthings in unexpected and somewhat startling relations to each other;\\nand such new relations are as unwelcome to the ordinary mind as poor\\nrelations to a _nouveau riche_. Who wants to be all the time painfully\\nconceiving of the antipodes walking like flies on the ceiling? Yet wit\\nis related to some of the profoundest qualities of the intellect. It is\\nthe reasoning faculty acting _per saltum_, the sense of analogy brought\\nto a focus; it is generalization in a flash, logic by the electric\\ntelegraph, the sense of likeness in unlikeness, that lies at the root\\nof all discoveries; it is the prose imagination, common-sense at fourth\\nproof. All this is no reason why the world should like it, however; and\\nwe fancy that the Question, _Ridentem dicere verum quid vetat?_ was\\nplaintively put in the primitive tongue by one of the world\\'s gray\\nfathers to another without producing the slightest conviction. Of\\ncourse, there must be some reason for this suspicion of wit, as there\\nis for most of the world\\'s deep-rooted prejudices. There is a kind of\\nsurface-wit that is commonly the sign of a light and shallow nature.\\nIt becomes habitual _persiflage_, incapable of taking a deliberate and\\nserious view of anything, or of conceiving the solemnities that environ\\nlife. This has made men distrustful of all laughers; and they are apt to\\nconfound in one sweeping condemnation with this that humor whose base\\nis seriousness, and which is generally the rebound of the mind from\\nover-sad contemplation. They do not see that the same qualities that\\nmake Shakspeare the greatest of tragic poets make him also the deepest\\nof humorists.\\n\\nDr. Holmes was already an author of more than a quarter of a century\\'s\\nstanding, and was looked on by most people as an _amusing_ writer\\nmerely. He protested playfully and pointedly against this, once or\\ntwice; but, as he could not help being witty, whether he would or no,\\nhis audience laughed and took the protest as part of the joke. He felt\\nthat he was worth a great deal more than he was vulgarly rated at, and\\nperhaps chafed a little; but his opportunity had not come. With the\\nfirst number of the \"Atlantic\" it came at last, and wonderfully he\\nprofited by it. The public were first delighted, and then astonished. So\\nmuch wit, wisdom, pathos, and universal Catharine-wheeling of fun and\\nfancy was unexampled. \"Why, good gracious,\" cried Madam Grundy, \"we\\'ve\\ngot a _genius_ among us fit last! I always knew what it would come to!\"\\n\"Got a fiddlestick!\" says Mr. G.; \"it\\'s only rockets.\" And there was no\\nlittle watching and waiting for the sticks to come down. We are afraid\\nthat many a respectable skeptic has a crick in his neck by this time;\\nfor we are of opinion that these are a new kind of rocket, that go\\nwithout sticks, and _stay up_ against all laws of gravity.\\n\\nWe expected a great deal from Dr. Holmes; we thought he had in him the\\nmakings of the best magazinist in the country; but we honestly confess\\nwe were astonished. We remembered the proverb, \"\\'Tis the pace that\\nkills,\" and could scarce believe that such a two-forty gait could be\\nkept up through a twelvemonth. Such wind and bottom were unprecedented.\\nBut this was Eclipse himself; and he came in as fresh as a May morning,\\nready at a month\\'s end for another year\\'s run. And it was not merely\\nthe perennial vivacity, the fun shading down to seriousness, and the\\nseriousness up to fun, in perpetual and charming vicissitude;--here was\\nthe man of culture, of scientific training, the man who had thought as\\nwell as felt, and who had fixed purposes and sacred convictions. No, the\\nEclipse-comparison is too trifling. This was a stout ship under press\\nof canvas; and however the phosphorescent star-foam of wit and fancy,\\ncrowding up under her bows or gliding away in subdued flashes of\\nsentiment in her wake, may draw the eye, yet she has an errand of duty;\\nshe carries a precious freight, she steers by the stars, and all her\\nseemingly wanton zigzags bring her nearer to port.\\n\\nWhen children have made up their minds to like some friend of the\\nfamily, they commonly besiege him for a story. The same demand is made\\nby the public of authors, and accordingly it was made of Dr. Holmes. The\\nodds were heavy against him; but here again he triumphed. Like a good\\nBostonian, he took for his heroine a _schoolma\\'am_, the Puritan Pallas\\nAthene of the American Athens, and made her so lovely that everybody was\\nlooking about for a schoolmistress to despair after. Generally, the best\\nwork in imaginative literature is done before forty; but Dr. Holmes\\nshould seem not to have found out what a Mariposa grant Nature had made\\nhim till after fifty.\\n\\nThere is no need of our analyzing \"Elsie Venner,\" for all our readers\\nknow it as well as we do. But we cannot help saying that Dr. Holmes has\\nstruck a new vein of New-England romance. The story is really a romance,\\nand the character of the heroine has in it an element of mystery; yet\\nthe materials are gathered from every-day New-England life, and that\\nweird borderland between science and speculation where psychology and\\nphysiology exercise mixed jurisdiction, and which rims New England as\\nit does all other lands. The character of Elsie is exceptional, but not\\npurely ideal, like Cristabel and Lamia. In Doctor Kittredge and his\\n\"hired man,\" and in the Principal of the \"Apollinean Institoot,\" Dr.\\nHolmes has shown his ability to draw those typical characters that\\nrepresent the higher and lower grades of average human nature; and in\\ncalling his work a Romance he quietly justifies himself for mingling\\nother elements in the composition of Elsie and her cousin. Apart from\\nthe merit of the book as a story, it is full of wit, and of sound\\nthought sometimes hiding behind a mask of humor. Admirably conceived are\\nthe two clergymen, gradually changing sides almost without knowing it,\\nand having that persuasion of consistency which men always feel, because\\nthey must always bring their creed into some sort of agreement with\\ntheir dispositions.\\n\\nThere is something melancholy in the fact, that, the moment Dr. Holmes\\nshowed that he felt a deep interest in the great questions which concern\\nthis world and the next, and proved not only that he believed in\\nsomething, but thought his belief worth standing up for, the cry of\\n_Infidel_ should have been raised against him by people who believe in\\nnothing but an authorized version of Truth, they themselves being the\\ncensors. For our own part, we do not like the smell of Smithfield,\\nwhether it be Catholic or Protestant that is burning there; though,\\nfortunately, one can afford to smile at the Inquisition, so long as its\\nActs of Faith are confined to the corners of sectarian newspapers.\\nBut Dr. Holmes can well afford to possess his soul in patience. The\\nUnitarian John Milton has won and kept quite a respectable place in\\nliterature, though he was once forced to say, bitterly, that \"new\\nPresbyter was only old Priest writ large.\" One can say nowadays, _E pur\\nsi muove_, with more comfort than Galileo could; the world does move\\nforward, and we see no great chance for any ingenious fellow-citizen to\\nmake his fortune by a \"Yankee Heretic-Baker,\" as there might have been\\ntwo centuries ago.\\n\\nDr. Holmes has proved his title to be a wit in the earlier and higher\\nsense of the word, when it meant a man of genius, a player upon thoughts\\nrather than words. The variety, freshness, and strength which he has\\nlent to our pages during the last three years seem to demand of us that\\nwe should add our expression of admiration to that which his countrymen\\nhave been so eager and unanimous in rendering.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRECENT AMERICAN PUBLICATIONS\\n\\nRECEIVED BY THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY.\\n\\n\\nHistory of the United Netherlands: from the Death of William the Silent\\nto the Synod of Dort.

GARDINER\\n\\nFORMERLY ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH IN HARVARD UNIVERSITY\\n\\n\\n\\n1912\\n\\n\\n\\nTO MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES ON THE STAFF OF ENGLISH A\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE\\n\\n\\nThe object of this book is to lay out a course in the writing of\\narguments which shall be simple enough for classes which give only a\\npart of the year to the work, and yet comprehensive enough for special\\nclasses in the subject. It is especially aimed at the interests and\\nneeds of the student body as a whole, however, rather than at those of\\nstudents who are doing advanced work in argumentation. Though few men\\nhave either the capacity or the need to become highly trained\\nspecialists in the making of arguments, all men need some knowledge of\\nthe art. Experience at Harvard has shown that pretty much the entire\\nfreshman class will work with enthusiasm on a single argument; and they\\nget from this work a training in exact thought and a discipline that\\nthey get from no other kind of writing.\\n\\nAccordingly I have laid out this book in order to start students as soon\\nas possible on the same kind of arguments that they are likely to make\\nin practical life. I have striven throughout to keep in mind the\\ninterests and needs of these average individuals, who in the aggregate\\nwill tread such a variety of paths in their passage through the world.\\nNot many of them will get to Congress, there to make great orations on\\nthe settlement of the tariff, and the large majority of them will not go\\ninto the law; and even of the lawyers many will have little concern with\\nthe elaborate piecing together of circumstantial evidence into the basis\\nfor a verdict. But all of them will sooner or later need the power of\\ncoming to close quarters with more or less complicated questions, in\\nwhich they must bring over to their views men of varying prepossessions\\nand practical interests; and all of them all their lives will need the\\npower of seeing through to the heart of such questions, and of grasping\\nwhat is essential, though it be separated by a hair\\'s breadth from the\\ninessential that must be cast to one side. It is for this training of\\nthe powers of thought that a course in the making of arguments is\\nprofitable, even when pursued for so short a time as can be given to it\\nin most schools and colleges.\\n\\nIn laying out the book I have had these three purposes in mind: first,\\nthat the student shall without waste of time be set to exploring his\\nsubject and running down the exact issues on which his question will\\ntarn; second, that as he collects his material he shall be led on to\\nconsider what part of it is good evidence for his purpose, and how to\\ntest his reasoning from the facts; third, that with his material\\ngathered and culled and his plan settled he shall turn his attention to\\npresenting it in the most effective way possible for the particular\\noccasion.\\n\\nThroughout I have tried to lay stress on the making of arguments, not as\\nan end in themselves, and to fit certain more or loss arbitrary\\nformulas, but as the practical kind of appeal that every young man is\\nalready making to his fellows on matters that interest him, and that he\\nwill make more and more in earnest as he gets out into the world. The\\ntendency of some of the books to treat argumentation, especially in the\\nform of debating, as a new variety of sport, with rules as elaborate and\\ntechnical as those of football, turns away from the subject a good many\\nyoung men to whom the training in itself would be highly valuable. The\\nfuture of the subject will be closely dependent on the success of\\nteachers in keeping it flexible and in intimate touch with real affairs.\\nI have made some suggestions looking towards this end in Appendix II.\\n\\nMy obligations to earlier workers in the field will be obvious to all\\nwho know the subject. In especial, I, like all other writers on the\\nsubject, have built on foundations laid by Professor George Pierce\\nBaker, of Harvard University.\\n\\nFor permission to use the articles from _The Outlook_ I am indebted to\\nthe courtesy of the editors of that journal; for the article on \"The\\nTransmission of Yellow Fever by Mosquitoes,\" to the kindness of General\\nSternberg, and of the editor of _The Popular Science Monthly_.\\n\\nJ.H. GARDINER\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MAKING OF ARGUMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\n\\nWHAT WE ARGUE ABOUT, AND WHY\\n\\n1. What Argument is. When we argue we write or speak with an active\\npurpose of making other people take our view of a case; that is the only\\nessential difference between argument and other modes of writing.\\nBetween exposition and argument there is no certain line. In Professor\\nLamont\\'s excellent little book, \"Specimens of Exposition,\" there are two\\nexamples which might be used in this book as examples of argument; in\\none of them, Huxley\\'s essay on \"The Physical Basis of Life,\" Huxley\\nhimself toward the end uses the words, \"as I have endeavored to prove to\\nyou\"; and Matthew Arnold\\'s essay on \"Wordsworth\" is an elaborate effort\\nto prove that Wordsworth is the greatest English poet after Shakespeare\\nand Milton. Or, to take quite different examples, in any question of law\\nwhere judges of the court disagree, as in the Income Tax Case, or in the\\nInsular cases which decided the status of Porto Rico and the\\nPhilippines, both the majority opinion and the dissenting opinions of\\nthe judges are argumentative in form; though the majority opinion, at\\nany rate, is in theory an exposition of the law. The real difference\\nbetween argument and exposition lies in the difference of attitude\\ntoward the subject in hand: when we are explaining we tacitly assume\\nthat there is only one view to be taken of the subject; when we argue we\\nrecognize that other people look on it differently. And the differences\\nin form are only those which are necessary to throw the critical points\\nof an argument into high relief and to warm the feelings of the readers.\\n\\n2. Conviction and Persuasion. This active purpose of making other\\npeople take your view of the case in hand, then, is the distinguishing\\nessence of argument. To accomplish this purpose you have two tools or\\nweapons, or perhaps one should say two sides to the same weapon,\\n_conviction_ and _persuasion_. In an argument you aim in the first place\\nto make clear to your audience that your view of the case is the truer\\nor sounder, or your proposal the more expedient; and in most arguments\\nyou aim also so to touch the practical or moral feelings of your readers\\nas to make them more or less warm partisans of your view. If you are\\ntrying to make some one see that the shape of the hills in New England\\nis due to glacial action, you never think of his feelings; here any\\nattempt at persuading him, as distinguished from convincing him, would\\nbe an impertinence. On the other hand, it would be a waste of breath to\\nconvince a man that the rascals ought to be turned out, if he will not\\non election day take the trouble to go out and vote; unless you have\\neffectively stirred his feelings as well as convinced his reason you\\nhave gained nothing. In the latter case your argument would be almost\\nwholly persuasive, in the former almost wholly a matter of convincing.\\n\\nThese two sides of argument correspond to two great faculties of the\\nhuman mind, thought and feeling, and to the two ways in which, under\\nthe guidance of thought and feeling, mankind reacts to experience. As we\\npass through life our actions and our interest in the people and things\\nwe meet are fixed in the first place by the spontaneous movements of\\nfeeling, and in the second place, and constantly more so as we grow\\nolder, by our reasoning powers. Even the most intentionally dry of\\nphilosophers has his prejudices, perhaps against competitive sports or\\nagainst efficiency as a chief test of good citizenship; and after\\nchildhood the most wayward of artists has some general principles to\\nguide him along his primrose path. The actions of all men are the\\nresultant of these two forces of feeling and reason. Since in most cases\\nwhere we are arguing we have an eye to influencing action, we must keep\\nboth the forces in mind as possible means to our end.\\n\\n3. Argument neither Contentiousness nor Dispute. Argument is not\\ncontentiousness, nor is it the good-natured and sociable disputation in\\nwhich we occupy a good deal of time with our friends. The difference is\\nthat in neither contentiousness nor in kindly dispute do we expect, or\\nintend, to get anywhere. There are many political speeches whose only\\nobject is to make things uncomfortable for the other side, and some\\nspeeches in college or school debates intended merely to trip up the\\nother side; and neither type helps to clear up the subjects it deals\\nwith. On the other hand, we spend many a pleasant evening arguing\\nwhether science is more important in education than literature, or\\nwhether it is better to spend the summer at the seashore or in the\\nmountains, or similar subjects, where we know that everybody will stand\\nat the end just where he stood at the beginning. Here our real purpose\\nis not to change any one\\'s views so much as it is to exchange thoughts\\nand likings with some one we know and care for. The purpose of\\nargument, as we shall understand the word here, is to convince or\\npersuade some one.\\n\\n4. Arguments and the Audience. In argument, therefore, far more than in\\nother kinds of writing, one must keep the audience definitely in mind.\\n\"Persuade\" and \"convince\" for our purposes are active verbs, and in most\\ncases their objects have an important effect on their significance. An\\nargument on a given subject that will have a cogent force with one set\\nof people, will not touch, and may even repel, another. To take a simple\\nexample: an argument in defense of the present game of football would\\nchange considerably in proportions and in tone according as it was\\naddressed to undergraduates, to a faculty, or to a ministers\\'\\nconference. Huxley\\'s argument on evolution (p. 233), which was delivered\\nto a popular audience, has more illustrations and is less compressed in\\nreasoning than if it had been delivered to the American Academy of Arts\\nand Sciences. Not only theoretically, but in practice, arguments must\\nvary in both form and substance with the audiences to which they are\\naddressed. An argument shot into the void is not likely to bring down\\nmuch game.\\n\\n5. Profitable Subjects for Arguments. To get the best results from\\npractice in writing arguments, you must choose your subjects with care\\nand sagacity. Some classes of subjects are of small value. Questions\\nwhich rest on differences of taste or temperament from their very nature\\ncan never be brought to a decision. The question whether one game is\\nbetter than another--football better than baseball, for example--is not\\narguable, for in the end one side settles down to saying, \"But I like\\nbaseball best,\" and you stick there. Closely akin is such a question as,\\nWas Alexander Pope a poet; for in the word \"poet\" one includes many\\npurely emotional factors which touch one person and not another. Matthew\\nArnold made a brave attempt to prove that Wordsworth stood third in\\nexcellence in the long line of English poets, and his essay is a notable\\npiece of argument; but the very statement of his thesis, that Wordsworth\\n\"left a body of poetical work superior in power, in interest, in the\\nqualities which give enduring freshness, to that which any of the others\\nhas left,\" shows the vanity of the attempt. To take a single\\nword--\"interest\"--from his proposition: what is the use of arguing with\\nme, if Wordsworth happened to bore me, as he does not, that I ought to\\nfind him interesting. All I could do would be humbly to admit my\\ndeficiency, and go as cheerfully as might be to Burns or Coleridge or\\nByron. Almost all questions of criticism labor under this difficulty,\\nthat in the end they are questions of taste. You or I were so made in\\nthe beginning that the so-called romantic school or the so-called\\nclassical school seems to us to have reached the pinnacle of art; and\\nall the argument in the world cannot make us over again in this respect.\\nEvery question which in the end involves questions of aesthetic taste is\\nas futile to argue as questions of the palate.\\n\\nOther questions are impracticable because of vagueness. Such questions\\nas, Should a practical man read poetry, Are lawyers a useful class in\\nthe community, Are the American people deteriorating, furnish excellent\\nmaterial for lively and witty talk, but no one expects them to lead to\\nany conclusion, and they are therefore valueless as a basis for the\\nrigorous and muscular training which an argument ought to give. There\\nare many questions of this sort which serve admirably for the friendly\\ndispute which makes up so much of our daily life with our friends, but\\nwhich dissolve when we try to pin them down.\\n\\nSome questions which cannot be profitably argued when phrased in general\\nterms become more practicable when they are applied to a definite class\\nor to a single person. Such questions as, Is it better to go to a small\\ncollege or a large one, Is it better to live in the country or in the\\ncity, Is it wise to go into farming, all lead nowhere if they are argued\\nin this general form. But if they are applied to a single person, they\\nchange character: in this specific form they not only are arguable, but\\nthey constantly are argued out with direct and practical results, and\\neven for a small and strictly defined class of persons they may provide\\ngood material for a formal argument. For example, the question, \"Is it\\nbetter for a boy of good intellectual ability and capacity for making\\nfriends, who lives in a small country town, to go to a small college or\\na large,\" provides moderately good material for an argument on either\\nside; though even here the limiting phrases are none too definite. In a\\ndebate on such a subject it would be easy for the two sides to pass each\\nother by without ever coming to a direct issue, because of differing\\nunderstanding of the terms. On the whole it seems wiser not to take\\nrisks with such questions, but to choose from those which will\\nunquestionably give you the training for which you are seeking.\\n\\nRoughly speaking, subjects for an argument which are sure to be\\nprofitable may be divided into three classes: (1) those for which the\\nmaterial is drawn from personal experience; (2) those for which the\\nmaterial is provided by reading; and (3) those which combine the first\\ntwo. Of these there can be no question that the last are the most\\nprofitable. Of the first class we may take for an example such a\\nquestion as, Should interscholastic athletics be maintained in----\\nschool? Here is a question on which some parents and teachers at any\\nrate will disagree with most boys, and a question which must be settled\\none way or the other. The material for the discussion must come from the\\npersonal knowledge of those who make the arguments, reenforced by what\\ninformation and opinion they can collect from teachers and townspeople.\\nIn Chapter II we shall come to a consideration of possible sources for\\nmaterial for these and other arguments. There is much to be said for the\\npractice gained by hunting up pertinent material for arguments of this\\nsort; but they tend to run over into irreconcilable differences of\\nopinion, in which an argument is of no practical value.\\n\\nThe second class of subjects, those for which the material is drawn\\nwholly from reading, is the most common in intercollegiate and\\ninterscholastic debates. Should the United States army canteen be\\nrestored, Should the Chinese be excluded from the Philippines, Should\\nthe United States establish a parcels post, are all subjects with which\\nthe ordinary student in high school or college can have little personal\\nacquaintance. The sources for arguments on such subjects are to be found\\nin books, magazines, and official reports. The good you will get from\\narguments on such subjects lies largely in finding out how to look up\\nmaterial. The difficulty with them lies in their size and their\\ncomplexity. When it is remembered that a column of an ordinary newspaper\\nhas somewhere about fifteen hundred words, and that an editorial article\\nsuch as on page 268, which is thirty-eight hundred words long, is in\\nthese days of hurry apt to be repellent, because of its length, and on\\nthe other hand that a theme of fifteen hundred words seems to the\\nordinary undergraduate a weighty undertaking, the nature of this\\ndifficulty becomes clear. To put it another way, speeches on public\\nsubjects of great importance are apt to be at least an hour long, and\\nnot infrequently more, and in an hour one easily speaks six or seven\\nthousand words, so that fifteen hundred words would not fill a\\nfifteen-minute speech. This difficulty is met in debates by the longer\\ntime allowed, for each side ordinarily has an hour; but even then there\\ncan be no pretense of a thorough treatment. The ordinary written\\nargument of a student in school or college can therefore do very little\\nwith large public questions. The danger is that a short argument on a\\nlarge question may breed in one an easy content with a superficial and\\nparrotlike discussion of the subject. Discussions of large and abstract\\nprinciples are necessary, but they are best left to the time of life\\nwhen one has a comprehensive and intimate knowledge of the whole mass of\\nfacts concerned.\\n\\nBy far the best kind of subject, as has been said, is that which will\\ncombine some personal acquaintance with the facts and the possibility of\\nsome research for material. Many such subjects may be found in the\\nlarger educational questions when applied to your own school or college.\\nShould the elective system be maintained at Harvard College, Should the\\nUniversity of Illinois require Latin for the A.B. degree, Should\\nfraternities be abolished in----High School, Should manual training be\\nintroduced in----High School, are all questions of this sort. A short\\nlist of similar questions is printed at the end of this section, which\\nit is hoped will prove suggestive. For discussing these questions you\\nwill find considerable printed material in educational and other\\nmagazines, in reports of presidents of colleges and school committees,\\nand other such places, which will give you practice in hunting up facts\\nand opinions and in weighing their value. At the same time training of\\nyour judgment will follow when you apply the theories and opinions you\\nfind in these sources to local conditions. Moreover, such questions will\\ngive you practice in getting material in the raw, as it were, by making\\nup tables of statistics from catalogues, by getting facts by personal\\ninterview, and in other ways, which will be considered in Chapter II.\\nFinally, such subjects are much more likely to be of a size that you can\\nbring to a head in the space and the time allowed to the average\\nstudent, and they may have some immediate and practical effect in\\ndetermining a question in which your own school or college has an\\ninterest. Arguments on such subjects are therefore less likely to be\\n\"academic\" discussions, in the sense of having no bearing on any real\\nconditions. When every college and school has plenty of such subjects\\ncontinually under debate, there seems to be no reason for going farther\\nand faring worse.\\n\\nThe main thing is to get a subject which will carry you back to facts,\\nand one in which you will be able to test your own reasoning.\\n\\n6. Suggestions of Subjects for Practice. Many of the subjects in\\nthe list below will need some adaptation to fit them to local\\nconditions; and these will undoubtedly suggest many others of a similar\\nnature. Other subjects of immediate and local interest may be drawn from\\nthe current newspapers; and the larger, perennial ones like prohibition,\\nwoman suffrage, immigration laws, are always at the disposal of those\\nwho have the time and the courage for the amount of reading they\\ninvolve. The distinction between a subject and the proposition to be\\nargued will be made in Chapter II.\\n\\n\\nSUGGESTIONS FOR SUBJECTS OF ARGUMENTS\\n\\nTO BE ADAPTED TO LOCAL AND PRESENT CONDITIONS\\n\\n1.

With the subject you are going to\\nargue on chosen, it will be wise to come to closer quarters with the\\nprocess of arguing. A large part of the good results you will get from\\npractice in writing arguments will be the strengthening of your powers\\nof exact and keen thought; I shall therefore in the following sections\\ntry to go somewhat below the surface of the process, and see just what\\nany given kind of argument aims to do, and how it accomplishes its aim\\nby its appeal to special faculties and interests of the mind. I shall\\nalso consider briefly the larger bearings of a few of the commoner and\\nmore important types of argument, as the ordinary citizen meets them in\\ndaily life.\\n\\nWe may divide arguments roughly into two classes, according as the\\nproposition they maintain takes the form, \"This is true,\" or the form,\\n\"This ought to be done.\" The former we will call, for the sake of\\nbrevity, arguments of fact, the latter arguments of policy. Of the two\\nclasses the former is addressed principally to the reason, the faculty\\nby which we arrange the facts of the universe (whether small or great)\\nas they come to us, and so make them intelligible. You believe that the\\nman who brought back your dog for a reward stole the dog, because that\\nview fits best with the facts you know about him and the disappearance\\nof the dog; we accept the theory of evolution because, as Huxley points\\nout at the beginning of his essay (see pp. 233, 235), it provides a\\nplace for all the facts that have been collected about the world of\\nplants and animals and makes of them all a consistent and harmonious\\nsystem. In Chapter III we shall come to a further consideration of the\\nworkings of this faculty so far as it affects the making of arguments.\\n\\nArguments of policy, on the other hand, which argue what ought to be\\ndone, make their appeal in the main to the moral, practical, Or\\naesthetic interests of the audience. These interests have their ultimate\\nroots in the deep-seated mass of inherited temperamental motives and\\nforces which may be summed up here in the conveniently vague term\\n\"feeling.\" These motives and forces, it will be noticed, lie outside the\\nfield of reason, and are in the main recalcitrant to it. When you argue\\nthat it is \"right\" that rich men should endow the schools and colleges\\nof this country, you would find it impossible to explain in detail just\\nwhat you mean by \"right\"; your belief rises from feelings, partly\\ninherited, partly drawn in with the air of the country, which make you\\npositive of your assertion even when you can least give reasons for it.\\nSo our practical interests turn in the end on what we want and do not\\nwant, and are therefore molded by our temperament and tastes, which are\\nobviously matters of feeling. Our aesthetic interests, which include our\\npreferences in all the fields of art and literature and things beautiful\\nor ugly in daily life, even more obviously go back to feeling. Now in\\npractical life our will to do anything is latent until some part of this\\ngreat body of feeling is stirred; therefore arguments of policy, which\\naim to show that something ought to be done, cannot neglect feeling. You\\nmay convince me never so thoroughly that I ought to vote the Republican\\nor the Democratic ticket, yet I shall sit still on election day if you\\ndo not touch my feelings of moral right or practical expediency. The\\nmoving cause of action is feeling, though the feeling is often modified,\\nor even transformed, by reasoning. We shall come back to the nature of\\nfeeling in Chapter V, when we get to the subject of persuasion.\\n\\nAn important practical difference between arguments of fact and\\narguments of policy lies in the different form and degree of certitude\\nto which they lead. At the end of arguments of fact it is possible to\\nsay, if enough evidence can be had, \"This is undeniably true.\" In these\\narguments we can use the word \"proof\" in its strict sense. In arguments\\nof policy on the other hand, where the question is worth arguing, we\\nknow in many cases that in the end there will be men who are as wise and\\nas upright as ourselves who will continue to disagree. In such cases it\\nis obvious that we can use the word \"proof\" only loosely; and we speak\\nof right or of expediency rather than of truth. This distinction is\\nworth bearing in mind, for it leads to soberness and a seemly modesty in\\ncontroversy. It is only in barber-shop politics and sophomore debating\\nclubs that a decision of a question of policy takes its place among the\\neternal verities.\\n\\nWith these distinctions made, let us now consider a few of the chief\\nvarieties of these two classes of arguments, dealing only with those\\nwhich every one of us comes to know in the practical affairs of life. It\\nwill be obvious that the divisions between these are not fixed, and that\\nthey are far from exhausting the full number of varieties.\\n\\n8. Arguments of Fact. Among the commonest and most important varieties\\nof arguments of fact are those made before juries in courts of law. It\\nis a fundamental principle of the common law under which we live that\\nquestions of fact shall be decided by twelve men chosen by lot from the\\ncommunity, and that questions of the law that shall be applied to these\\nfacts shall be decided by the judges. Accordingly in criminal trials the\\nfacts concerning the crime and the actions and whereabouts of the\\naccused are subjects of argument by the counsel. If the prisoner is\\nattempting to establish an alibi, and the evidence is meager or\\nconflicting, his counsel and the prosecuting officer must each make\\narguments before the jury on the real meaning of the evidence. In civil\\ncases likewise, all disputed questions of fact go ordinarily to a jury,\\nand are the subject of arguments by the opposing lawyers. Did the\\ndefendant guarantee the goods he sold the plaintiff? Was undue influence\\nexerted on the testator? Did the accident happen through the negligence\\nof the railroad officials? In such cases and the countless others that\\ncongest the lists of the lower courts arguments of fact must be made.\\n\\nOther common arguments of fact are those in historical questions,\\nwhether in recent or in ancient history. Macaulay\\'s admirable skeleton\\nargument (p. 155) that Philip Francis wrote the _Junius Letters_, which\\nso grievously incensed the English government about the time of the\\nAmerican Revolution, is an example of an argument of this sort; the part\\nof Lincoln\\'s Cooper Institute Address which deals with the views of the\\nfounders of the nation on the subject of the control of slavery in the\\nterritories is another. Another question concerning facts is that which\\na few years ago stirred classical archaeologists, whether the Greek\\ntheater had a raised stage or not. In all such cases the question is as\\nto facts which at one time, at any rate, could have been settled\\nabsolutely. The reason why an argument about them becomes necessary is\\nthat the evidence which could finally settle the questions has\\ndisappeared with the persons who possessed it, or has been dissipated by\\ntime. Students of history and literature have to deal with many such\\nquestions of fact.\\n\\nA somewhat different kind of question of fact, and one often extremely\\ndifficult to settle, is that which concerns not a single, uncomplicated\\nfact, but a broad condition of affairs. Examples of such questions are\\nwhether woman suffrage has improved political conditions in Colorado and\\nother states, whether the introduction of manual training in a certain\\nhigh school has improved the intelligence and serviceableness of its\\ngraduates, whether political corruption is decreasing in American\\ncities. The difficulty that faces an argument in such cases as these is\\nnot the loss of the evidence, but rather that it consists of a multitude\\nof little facts, and that the selection of these details is singularly\\nsubject to bias and partisan feeling. These questions of a broad state\\nof affairs are like questions of policy in that in the end their\\nsettlement depends thus largely on temperamental and practical\\nprepossessions.\\n\\nStill another and very important variety of arguments of fact, which are\\noften conveniently described as arguments of theory, includes large\\nscientific questions, such, for example, as the origin of our present\\nspecies of plants and animals, or the ultimate constitution of matter,\\nor the cause of yellow fever. In such arguments we start out with many\\nfacts, already gained through observation and experiment, which need the\\nassumption of some other fact or facts attained through reasoning from\\nthe others, to make them fit together into a coherent and intelligible\\nsystem. Every important new discovery in science makes necessary\\narguments of this sort. When the minute forms of life that the layman\\nlumps together under the name \"germs\" were discovered there was a host\\nof arguments to explain their manner of life and the way some of them\\ncause disease and others carry on functions beneficent to mankind. A\\nnotable example of the arguments concerning this kind of fact is that at\\npage 251 concerning the cause of yellow fever; and another is Huxley\\'s\\nargument on evolution (p. 233), where he points out that \"the question\\nis a question of historical fact.\" The element of uncertainty in the\\nsettlement of such questions is due to the facts being too large or too\\nminute for human observation, or to their ranging through great ages of\\ntime so that we must be contented with overwhelming probability rather\\nthan with absolute proof. Furthermore the facts that are established in\\narguments of this sort may have to be modified by new discoveries: for\\nmany generations it was held to be a fact that malaria was caused by a\\nmiasma; now we know that it is caused by a germ, which is carried by\\nmosquitoes. Arguments of this type tend to go through a curious cycle:\\nthey begin their life as arguments, recognized as such; then becoming\\nthe accepted explanation of the facts which are known, for a longer or\\nshorter time they flourish as statements of the truth; and then with the\\nuncovering of new facts they crumble away or are transformed into new\\nand larger theories. Darwin\\'s great theory of the origin of species has\\npassed through two of these stages. He spoke of it as an argument, and\\nfor a few years it was assailed with fierce counterarguments; we now\\nhold it to be a masterful explanation of an enormous body of facts. When\\nit will pass on to the next stage we cannot foresee; but chemists and\\nphysicists darkly hint at the possibility of the evolution of inorganic\\nas well as organic substances.\\n\\nIn arguments of fact, it will be noticed, there is little or no element\\nof persuasion, for we deal with such matters almost wholly through our\\nunderstanding and reason. Huxley, in his argument on evolution, which\\nwas addressed to a popular audience, was careful to choose examples that\\nwould be familiar; but his treatment of the subject was strictly\\nexpository in tone. In some arguments of this sort, which touch on the\\ngreat forces of the universe and on the nature of the world of life of\\nwhich we are an infinitesimal part, the tone of the discourse will take\\non warmth and eloquence; just as Webster in the White Murder Case,\\ndealing with an issue of life and death, let the natural eloquence which\\nalways smoldered in his speech, burn up into a clear glow. But both\\nHuxley and Webster would have held any studied appeal to emotion to be\\nan impertinence.\\n\\nIn ordinary life most of us make fewer arguments of fact than of policy.\\nIt is only a small minority of our young men who become lawyers, and of\\nthem many do not practice before juries. Nor do any large number of men\\nbecome scholars or men of science or public men, who have to deal with\\nquestions of historical fact or to make arguments of fact on large\\nstates of affairs. On the other hand, all of us have to weigh and\\nestimate arguments of fact pretty constantly. Sooner or later most men\\nserve on juries; and all students have to read historical and economical\\narguments. We shall therefore give some space in Chapter III to\\nconsidering the principles of reasoning by which we arrive at and test\\nconclusions as to the existence of facts, and the truth of assertions\\nabout them.\\n\\n9. Arguments of Policy. When we turn from arguments of fact to\\narguments of policy it will be noticed that there is a change in the\\nphraseology that we use: we no longer say that the assertions we\\nmaintain or meet are true or not true, but that the proposals are right\\nor expedient or wrong or inexpedient; for now we are talking about what\\nshould or should not be done. We say, naturally and correctly, that it\\nis or is not true that woman suffrage has improved political conditions\\nin Colorado but it would be a misuse of words to say that it is true or\\nnot true that woman suffrage should be adopted in Ohio; and still more\\nso to use the word \"false,\" which has an inseparable tinge of moral\\nobliquity. In questions of policy that turn on expediency, and in some,\\nas we shall see directly, that turn on moral issues, we know beforehand\\nthat in the end some men who know the subject as well as we do and whose\\njudgment is as good and whose standards are as high, will still\\ndisagree. There are certain large temperamental lines which have always\\ndivided mankind: some men are born conservative minded, some radical\\nminded: the former must needs find things as they are on the whole good,\\nthe latter must needs see vividly how they can be improved. To the\\nscientific temperament the artistic temperament is unstable and\\nirrational, as the former is dry and ungenerous to the latter. Such\\nbroad and recognized types, with a few others like them, ramify into a\\nmultitude of ephemeral parties and classes,--racial, political, social,\\nliterary, scholarly,--and most of the arguments in the world can be\\nfollowed back to these essential and irremovable differences of\\ncharacter. Individual practical questions, however, cross and recross\\nthese lines, and in such cases arguments have much practical effect in\\ncrystallizing opinion and judgment; for in a complicated case it is\\noften extremely hard to see the real bearing of a proposed policy, and a\\ngood argument comes as a guide from the gods to the puzzled and\\nwavering. But though to be effective in practical affairs one has to be\\npositive, yet that is not saying that one must believe that the other\\nside are fools or knaves. Some such confusion of thought in the minds of\\nsome reformers, both eminent and obscure, accounts for the wake of\\nbitterness which often follows the progress of reform. Modesty and\\ntoleration are as important as positiveness to the man who is to make a\\nmark in the world.\\n\\nArguments of policy are of endless variety, for we are all of us making\\nthem all the time, from the morning hour in which we argue with\\nourselves, so often ineffectually, that we really ought to get up when\\nthe clock strikes, to the arguments about choosing a profession or\\nhelping to start a movement for universal peace. It would be a weariness\\nto the flesh to attempt a classification of them that should pretend to\\nbe exhaustive; but there are certain major groups of human motive which\\nwill be a good basis for a rough, but convenient, sorting out of the\\ncommoner kinds of arguments of policy. In practical affairs we ask first\\nif there is any principle of right or wrong involved, then what is best\\nfor the practical interests of ourselves and other people, and in a few\\ncases, when these other considerations are irrelevant, what course is\\ndictated by our ideas of fitness and beauty. I will briefly discuss a\\nfew of the main types of the argument of policy, grouping them according\\nas they appeal chiefly to the sense of right and wrong, to practical\\ninterests, or to aesthetic interests.\\n\\nThere are many arguments outside of sermons which turn on questions of\\nright and wrong. Questions of individual personal conduct we had better\\nnot get into; but every community, whether large or small, has often to\\nface questions in which moral right and wrong are essentially involved.\\nIn this country the whole question of dealing with the sale of alcoholic\\ndrinks is recognized as such. The supporters of state prohibition\\ndeclare that it is morally wrong to sanction a trade out of which\\nsprings so much misery; the supporters of local option and high license,\\nadmitting and fighting against all this misery and crime, declare that\\nit is morally wrong to shut one\\'s eyes to the uncontrolled sales and the\\npolitical corruption under state-wide prohibition. The strongest\\narguments for limiting by law the hours of labor for women and children\\nhave always been based on moral principles; and all arguments for\\npolitical reform hark back to the Ten Commandments. One has the\\nstrongest of all arguments if he can establish a moral right and wrong\\nin the question.\\n\\nThe difficulty comes in establishing the right and wrong, for there are\\nmany cases where equally good people are fighting dead against each\\nother. The question of prohibition, as we have just seen, is one of\\nthose cases; the slavery question was a still more striking one. From\\nbefore the Revolution the feeling that slavery was morally wrong slowly\\nbut steadily gained ground in the North, until from 1850 it became more\\nand more a dominant and passionate conviction.[1] Yet in the South,\\nwhich, as we must now admit, bred as many men and women of high devotion\\nto the right, this view had only scattered followers. On both sides\\ntradition and environment molded the moral principle. In arguing,\\ntherefore, one must not be too swift in calling on heaven to witness to\\nthe right; we must recognize that mortal vision is weak, and that some\\nof the people whom we are fighting are borne on by principles as\\nsincerely held to be righteous as our own.\\n\\nNevertheless, a man must always hold to that which to him seems right,\\nand fight hard against the wrong, tolerantly and with charity, but with\\nunclouded purpose. In politics there are still in this country many\\noccasions when the only argument possible is based on moral right. The\\ndebauching of public servants by favors or bribes, whether open or\\nindirect, injustice of all sorts, putting men who are mentally or\\nmorally unfit into public office, oppression of the poor or unjust\\nbleeding of the rich, stirring up class or race hatred, are all evils\\nfrom which good citizens must help to save the republic; and wherever\\nsuch evils are found the moral argument is the only argument worthy of a\\ndecent citizen.\\n\\nBy far the most numerous of arguments of policy, however, are those\\nwhich do not rise above the level of practical interests. The line\\nbetween these and arguments of moral right is not always easy to draw,\\nfor in the tangle of life and character right and advantage often run\\ntogether. The tariff question is a case in point. Primarily it turns on\\nthe practical material advantage of a nation; but inevitably in the\\nsettling of individual schedules the way opens for one industry or\\nbranch of business to fatten at the expense of another, and so we run\\ninto the question of the square deal and the golden rule.\\n\\nIn general, however, the great questions on which political parties\\ndivide are questions of practical expediency. Shall we, as a nation, be\\nmore comfortable and more prosperous if the powers of the federal\\ngovernment are strengthened and extended? Shall we have better local\\ngovernment under the old-fashioned form of city government, or under\\nsome form of commission government? Should we have more business and\\nmore profitable business if we had free trade with the Dominion of\\nCanada? Shall we be better off under the Republican or the Democratic\\nparty? All these are questions in which there is little concern with\\nright and wrong: they turn on the very practical matter of direct\\nmaterial advantage. In some of these cases most men vote on one side or\\nthe other largely through long habit; but there constantly arise,\\nespecially in local matters, questions which cross the usual lines of\\npolitical division, so that one, willingly or unwillingly, must take the\\ntrouble of thinking out a decision for himself. Not infrequently one is\\na good deal puzzled to decide on which side to range himself, for the\\nissues may be complex; then one reads the arguments or goes to meetings\\nuntil one side or the other seems to present the most and the most\\nimportant advantages. When one is thus puzzled, an argument which is\\nclear and easy to understand, and which makes its points in such a way\\nthat they can be readily carried in mind and passed on to the next\\nperson one meets, has a wonderful power of winning one to its side.\\n\\nThe arguments of policy which, after political arguments, are the most\\ncommon, are those on questions of law. As we have seen a few pages\\nback, such arguments are settled by the judges, while questions of fact\\nare left to the jury. In the White Murder Case, in which Daniel Webster\\nmade a famous argument, it was a question of fact for the jury whether\\nthe defendant Knapp was in Brown Street at the time of the murder, and\\nwhether he was there for the purpose of aiding and abetting\\nCrowninshield, the actual murderer; the question whether his presence\\noutside the house would make him liable as a principal in the crime was\\na question of law. This distinction between questions of fact and\\nquestions of law is one of the foundation principles of the common law.\\nFrom the very beginning of the jury system, when the jury consisted of\\nneighbors who found their verdict from their own knowledge of the case,\\nto the present day when they are required carefully to purge their minds\\nof any personal knowledge of the case, the common law has always held\\nthat in the long run questions of fact can best be settled by average\\nmen, drawn by lot from the community. Questions of law, on the other\\nhand, need learning and special training in legal reasoning, for the\\ncommon law depends on continuity and consistency of decision; and a new\\ncase must be decided by the principles which have governed like cases in\\nthe past.\\n\\nNevertheless, these principles, which are now embodied in an enormous\\nmass of decisions by courts all over the English-speaking world, are in\\nessence a working out into minute discriminations of certain large\\nprinciples, which in turn are merely the embodiment of the practical\\nrules under which the Anglo-Saxon race has found it safest and most\\nconvenient to live together. They settle in each case what, in view of\\nthe interests of the community as a whole and in the long run, and not\\nmerely for the parties now at issue, is the most convenient and the\\njustest thing to do. Mr. Justice Holmes, of the Supreme Court of the\\nUnited States, wrote before his appointment to that bench:\\n\\n\"In substance the growth of the law is legislative. And this in a deeper\\nsense than that what the courts declare to have always been the law is\\nin fact new. It is legislative in its grounds. The very considerations\\nwhich judges most rarely mention, and always with an apology, are the\\nsecret roots from which tine law draws all the juices of life. I mean of\\ncourse considerations of what is expedient for the community concerned.\\nEvery important principle which is developed by litigation is in fact\\nand at bottom the result of move or less definitely understood views of\\npublic policy; most generally, to be sure, under our practices and\\ntraditions, the unconscious result of instinctive preferences and\\ninarticulate convictions, but none the less traceable to views of public\\npolicy in the last analysis.\"[2]\\n\\nIn some cases it is obvious that the question of law is a question of\\npolicy, as in the so-called \"political decisions\" of the United States\\nSupreme Court. Such were the decisions formulated by Chief Justice\\nMarshall on constitutional questions, which made our government what it\\nis. The difference between \"the strict construction\" of the Constitution\\nand the \"free construction\" was due to a difference of temperament which\\nhas always tended to mark the two great political parties of the\\ncountry. So with the Insular cases, which determined the status of the\\ndistant possessions of the United Stales, and which split the Supreme\\nCourt into so many pieces: the question whether the Constitution applied\\nin all its fullness to Porto Rico and the Philippines was essentially a\\npolitical question, though of the largest sort, and therefore a question\\nof policy.\\n\\nFinally, there are the arguments of policy which deal with matters of\\ntaste and aesthetic preference. The difficulty with these arguments is\\nthat they do deal with questions of taste, and so fall under the ancient\\nand incontrovertible maxim, _de gustibus non est disputandum_. Artists\\nof all varieties and some critics are given to talking as if preferences\\nin color, in shape, in styles of music, were absolutely right and wrong,\\nand as if they partook in some way of the nature of moral questions; but\\nany one who has observed for even twenty years knows that what the\\narchitects of twenty years ago declared the only true style of art is\\nnow scoffed at by them and their successors as hopelessly false. The\\ncavelike forms of the Byzantine or Romanesque which superseded the\\nwooden Gothic have in turn given way to Renaissance classic in its\\nvarious forms, which now in turn seem on the point of slipping into the\\nrococo classical of the Ecole des Beaux Arts. In painting, the violent\\nand spotty impressionism of twenty years ago is paling into the study of\\nthe cool and quiet lights of the Dutchmen of the great period.[3] And at\\neach stage there are strenuous arguments that the ideas of that\\nparticular live years are the only hope for the preservation of the art\\nconcerned.\\n\\nThe essential difficulty with all such arguments is that the aesthetic\\ninterests to which they appeal are personal, and depend on personal\\npreferences. Most of us in such matters, having no special knowledge,\\nand liking some variety of differing styles, modestly give way to the\\nauthority of any one who makes a profession of the art. In the laying\\nout of a park a landscape architect may prefer single trees and open\\nspaces, where the neighbors and abutters prefer a grove. In the long run\\nhis taste is no better than theirs, though he may argue as if they were\\nignorant and uncultivated because they disagree with him. In all such\\ncases, unless there is some consideration of practical expediency, such\\nas letting the southwest wind blow through in summer, arguments can do\\nlittle except to make and keep everybody angry. Their chief value is to\\nmake us see things which perhaps we had not thought of.\\n\\nIn practice these three kinds of arguments, which turn on moral,\\npractical, and aesthetic considerations, tend to be much mingled. The\\nhuman mind is very complex, and our various interests and preferences\\nare inseparably tangled. The treacheries of self-analysis are\\nproverbial, and are only less dangerous than trying to make out the\\nmotives of other people. Accordingly we must expect to find that it is\\nsometimes hard to distinguish between moral and aesthetic motives and\\npractical, for the morality and the taste of a given people always in\\npart grow out of the slow crystallizing of practical expediencies, and\\nnotions of morality change with the advance of civilization.\\n\\nFurthermore, one must never forget that an argument of policy which\\ndoes not involve and rest on subsidiary questions of fact is rare; and\\nthe questions of fact must be settled before we can go on with the\\nargument of policy. Before this country can intelligently make up its\\nmind about the protective tariff, and whether a certain rate of duty\\nshould be imposed on a given article, a very complex body of facts\\ndealing with the cost of production both here and abroad must be\\nsettled, and this can be done only by men highly trained in the\\nprinciples of business and political economy. Before one could vote\\nintelligently on the introduction of a commission form of government\\ninto the town he lives in he must know the facts about the places in\\nwhich it has already been tried. It is not too much to say that there is\\nno disputed question of policy into which there does not enter the\\nnecessity of looking up and settling pertinent facts.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there are some cases of questions of fact in which\\nour practical interests deeply affect the view which we take of the\\nfacts. In all the discussions of the last few years about federal\\nsupervision and control of the railroads it has been hard to get at the\\nfacts because of the conflicting statements about them by equally honest\\nand well-informed men. Where there is an honest difference of interest,\\nas in every case of a bargain, the opposite sides cannot see the facts\\nin the same way: what is critically significant to the railroad manager\\nseems of no great consequence to the shipper; and the railroad manager\\ndoes not see the fixed laws of trade which make it impossible for the\\nshipper to pay higher freight rates and add them to the price of his\\ngoods. It is not in human nature to see the whole cogency of facts that\\nmake for the other side. In all arguments, therefore, it must be\\nremembered that we are; constantly swinging backward and forward from\\nmatters of fact to matters of policy. In practice no hard-and-fast line\\nseparates the various classes and types; in the arguments of real life\\nwe mingle them naturally and unconsciously.\\n\\nYet the distinction between the two main classes is a real one, and if\\none has never thought it out, one may go at an argument with a blurred\\nnotion of what he is attempting to do. Since argument after school and\\ncollege is an eminently practical matter, vagueness of aim is risky. It\\nis the man who sees exactly what he is trying to do, and knows exactly\\nwhat he can accomplish, who is likely to make his point. The chief value\\nof writing arguments for practice is in cultivating a keen eye for the\\nessential. To write a good argument means, as we shall see, that the\\nstudent shall first conscientiously take the question, apart so as to\\nknow exactly the issues involved and the unavoidable points of\\ndifference, and then after searching the sources for information, he\\nshall scrutinize the facts and the reasoning both on his own side and on\\nthe other. If he does this work without shirking the hard thinking he\\nwill get an illuminating perception of the obscurities and ambiguities\\nwhich lurk in words, and will come to see that clear reasoning is almost\\nwholly a matter of sharper discrimination for unobserved distinctions.\\n\\nEXERCISES\\n\\n1.

When you have chosen the subject\\nfor your argument there is still much to do before you are ready to\\nwrite it out. In the first place, you must find out by search and\\nreading what is to be said both for and against the view you are\\nsupporting; in the second place, with the facts in mind you must analyze\\nboth them and the question to see just what is the point that you are\\narguing; then, in the third place, you must arrange the material you are\\ngoing to use so that it will be most effective for your purpose. Each of\\nthese steps I shall consider in turn in this chapter.\\n\\nAs a practical convenience, each student should start a notebook, in\\nwhich he can keep together all the notes he makes in the course of his\\npreparations for writing the argument. Number the pages of the notebook,\\nand leave the first two pages blank for a table of contents. A box of\\ncards, such as will be described on page 31, will serve as well as a\\nnotebook, and in some ways is more convenient. From time to time, in the\\ncourse of the chapter I shall mention points that should be entered.\\n\\nFor the sake of convenience in exposition I shall use as an example the\\npreparations for an argument in favor of introducing the commission form\\nof government into an imaginary city, Wytown; and each of the directions\\nfor the use of the notebook I shall illustrate by entries appropriate\\nto this argument. The argument, let us suppose, is addressed to the\\ncitizens of the place, who know the general facts relating to the city\\nand its government. In creating this imaginary city, let us give it\\nabout eight thousand inhabitants, and suppose that it is of small area,\\nand that the inhabitants are chiefly operatives in a number of large\\nshoe factories, of American descent, though foreign-born citizens and\\ntheir offspring are beginning to gain on the others. And further, let us\\nsuppose that this imaginary city of Wytown now has a city government\\nwith a mayor of limited powers, a small board of aldermen, and a larger\\ncity council. The other necessary facts will appear in the introduction\\nto the brief.\\n\\n11. Reading for the Argument. The first step in preparing for an\\nargument is to find out what has been already written on the general\\nsubject, and what facts are available for your purpose. For this purpose\\nyou must go to the best library that is within convenient reach. Just\\nhow to look for material there I shall discuss a few pages further on;\\nhere I shall make some more general suggestions about reading and taking\\nnotes.\\n\\nAlmost always it pays to give two or three hours to some preliminary\\nreading that will make you see the general scope of the subject, and the\\npoints on which there is disagreement. An article in a good encyclopedia\\nor one in a magazine may serve the purpose; or in some cases you can go\\nto the opening chapter or two of a book. If you have already discussed\\nthe subject with other people this preliminary reading may not be\\nnecessary; but if you start in to read on a new subject without some\\ngeneral idea of its scope you may waste time through not knowing your\\nway and so following false leads.\\n\\nIn your reading do not rest satisfied with consulting authorities on\\nyour own side only. We shall presently see how important it is to be\\nprepared to meet arguments on the other side; and unless you have read\\nsomething on that side, you will not know what points you ought to deal\\nwith in your refutation. In that event you may leave undisturbed in the\\nminds of your readers points which have all the more significance from\\nyour having ignored them. One of the first reasons for wide reading in\\npreparation for an argument is to assure yourself that you have a\\ncompetent knowledge of the other side as well as of your own.\\n\\nIn using your sources keep clearly and constantly in mind the difference\\nbetween fact and opinion. The opinions of a great scholar and of a\\nfarseeing statesman may be based on fact; but not being fact they\\ncontain some element of inference, which is never as certain. When we\\ncome to the next chapter we shall consider this difference more closely.\\nIn the meantime it is worth while to urge the importance of cultivating\\nscruples on the subject and a keen eye for the intrusion of human, and\\ntherefore fallible, opinion into statements of fact. A trustworthy\\nauthor states the facts as facts, with the authorities for them\\nspecifically cited; and where he builds his own opinions on the facts he\\nleaves no doubt as to where fact ends and opinion begins.\\n\\nThe power to estimate a book or an article on a cursory inspection is of\\ngreat practical value. The table of contents in a book, and sometimes\\nthe index, will give a good idea of its scope; and samples of a few\\npages at a time, especially on critical points, which can be chosen by\\nmeans of the index, will show its general attitude and tone. The index,\\nif properly made, will furnish a sure guide to its relevance for the\\npurpose in hand. Half an hour spent in this way, with attention\\nconcentrated, will in most cases settle whether the book is worth\\nreading through. An article can be \"sized up\" in much the same way:\\nif it is at all well written the first paragraphs will give a pretty\\ndefinite idea of the subject and the scope of the article; and the\\nbeginnings, and often the ends, of the paragraphs will show the course\\nwhich the thought follows. Though such skimming cannot be relied on for\\na real knowledge of the subject, it is invaluable as a guide for this\\npreliminary reading.\\n\\n12. Taking Notes. In reading for your argument, as for all\\nscholarly reading, form early your habits of taking thorough and\\nserviceable notes. Nothing is more tantalizing than to remember that you\\nonce ran across a highly important fact and then not be able to recall\\nthe place in which it is to be found.\\n\\nOne of the most convenient ways to take notes for an argument is to\\nwrite each fact or quotation on a separate card. Cards convenient for\\nthe purpose can be had at any college stationer or library-supply\\nbureau. If you use them, have an ample supply of them, so that you will\\nnot have to put more than one fact on each. Leave space for a heading at\\nthe top which will refer to a specific subheading of your brief, when\\nthat is ready. Always add an exact reference to the source--title, name\\nof author, and, in case of a book, place and date of publication, so\\nthat if you want more material you can find it without loss of time,\\nand, what is more important, so that you can fortify your use of it by a\\nreference in a footnote. When you find a passage that you think will be\\nworth quoting in the original words, quote with scrupulous and literal\\naccuracy: apart from the authority you gain by so doing, you have no\\nright to make any one else say words he did not say. If you leave out\\npart of the passage, show the omission by dots; and in such a case, if\\nyou have to supply words of your own, as for example a noun in place of\\na pronoun, use square brackets, thus []. On the following page are\\nexamples of a convenient form of such notes.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nRESULTS IN DES MOINES\\n\\nThe streets have been kept cleaner than ever before for $35,000.\\nThe rates for electric lights have been reduced from $90 to $65.\\nGas rates have dropped again from $22 to $17.\\nWater rates have dropped from 30c to 20c per 1000 gal.\\nThe disreputable district has been cleaned up and bond sharks\\ndriven out of business.\\n\\nThe Des Moines Plan of City Government, _World\\'s Work_, Vol. XVIII,\\nP. 11533.\\n\\n\\nPRESIDENT ELIOT\\'S VIEWS\\n\\n\"Now city business is almost wholly administrative and executive\\nand very little concerned with large plans and far-reaching legislation.\\nThere is no occasion for two legislative bodies, or even one, in the\\ngovernment of a city.... Now and then a question arises which the\\nwill of the whole people properly expressed may best settle; but\\nfor the prompt and conclusive expression of that will the initiative\\nand referendum are now well-recognized means.\"\\n\\nC. W. Eliot, City Government by Fewer Men, _World\\'s Work_, Vol. XIV\\np. 9419.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIn making notes, whether for an argument or for general college work, it\\nis convenient, unless you know shorthand, to have a system of signs and\\nabbreviations and of contractions for common words. The simpler\\nshorthand symbols can be pressed into service; and one can follow the\\npractice of stenography, which was also that of the ancient Hebrew\\nwriting, of leaving out vowels, for there are few words that cannot be\\nrecognized at a glance from their consonants. If you use this system at\\nlectures you can soon come surprisingly near to a verbatim report which\\nwill preserve something more than bare facts.\\n\\nIn your reading for material do not cultivate habits of economy or\\nparsimony. You should always have a considerable amount of good fact\\nleft over, for unless you know a good deal of the region on the\\noutskirts of your argument you will feel cramped and uncertain within\\nit. The effect of having something in reserve is a powerful, though an\\nintangible, asset in an argument; and, on the other hand, the man who\\nhas emptied his magazine is in a risky situation.\\n\\n13. Sources for Facts. In the main, there are two kinds of sources\\nfor facts, sources in which the facts have already been collected and\\ndigested, and sources where they are still scattered and must be brought\\ntogether and grouped by the investigator. Obviously there is no sharp or\\npermanent distinction between these two classes. Let us first run\\nthrough some of the books which are commonly available as sources of\\neither kind, and then come back to the use of them.\\n\\nTo find material in books and magazines there are certain well-known\\nguides. To look up books go first to the catalogue of the nearest\\nlibrary. Here in most cases you will find some sort of subject\\ncatalogue, in which the subjects are arranged alphabetically; and if you\\ncan use the alphabet readily, as by no means all college students can,\\nyou can soon get a list of the books that are there available on the\\nsubject. On many subjects there are bibliographies, or lists of books,\\nsuch as those published by the Library of Congress; these will be found\\nin every large library. For articles in magazines and weekly journals,\\nwhich on most current questions have fresh information, besides a great\\ndeal of valuable material on older questions, go to Poole\\'s \"Index to\\nPeriodical Literature,\" which is an index both by title and subject to\\nthe articles in important English and American magazines from 1802 to\\n1906, and to \"The Reader\\'s Guide to Periodical Literature,\" which began\\nin 1901 and includes more magazines, and which is brought up to date\\nevery month.\\n\\nFor other material the works listed below will be serviceable; they are\\nthe best known of the reference books, and some of them will be found in\\nall libraries and all of them in large libraries. The books on this list\\nby no means exhaust the number of good books of their own kind; they are\\ngood examples, and others will ordinarily be found on the same shelves\\nwith them.\\n\\n                         DICTIONARIES\\n\\nTHE NEW ENGLISH DICTIONARY (MURRAY\\'S) Unfinished: to have ten volumes,\\nof which nine have now been published. This gives the history of each\\nword for the last seven hundred years, with copious quotations, dated,\\nto show the changes in its use.\\n\\nTHE CENTURY DICTIONARY, CYCLOPEDIA OF NAMES, AND ATLAS New edition,\\n1911, in twelve volumes. This has fuller information about the meanings\\nof the words than is usually found in a dictionary.\\n\\nTHE NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY (WEBSTER\\'S) New edition, 1910,\\nenlarged, with copious and exact etymologies.\\n\\nROGET\\'S THESAURUS OF ENGLISH WORDS AND PHRASES A standard book of\\nsynonyms.\\n\\nFERNALD, ENGLISH SYNONYMS, ANTONYMS, AND PREPOSITIONS With illustrations\\nand expositions of the differences in meaning.\\n\\n                         ENCYCLOPEDIAS\\n\\nENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA Very full; highly authoritative; 11th edition,\\n1910.\\n\\nNEW INTERNATIONAL ENCYCLOPEDIA Briefer; reedited in 1904.\\n\\nLA GRANDE ENCYCLOPIDIE; BROCKHAUS, KONVERSATIONS-LEXIKON Both copious\\nand authoritative.\\n\\nALLUSIONS AND QUOTATIONS\\n\\nCRUDEN\\'S CONCORDANCE An index to every word in the Bible.\\n\\nBARTLETT\\'S CONCORDANCE TO SHAKESPEARE An index to every word in\\nShakespeare.\\n\\nBARTLETT\\'S FAMILIAR QUOTATIONS An index to a very large number of the\\nquotations most frequently met with.\\n\\nBREWER\\'S DICTIONARY OF PHRASE AND FABLE This explains a great quantity\\nof common allusions in words and phrases.\\n\\n                         DICTIONARIES OF PROPER NAMES\\n\\nCENTURY CYCLOPEDIA OF NAMES This includes not only names of real\\npersons, but also those of many famous characters in fiction.\\n\\nLIPPINCOTT\\'S UNIVERSAL PRONOUNCING DICTIONARY OF BIOGRAPHY AND MYTHOLOGY\\n\\nDICTIONARY OF NATIONAL BIOGRAPHY Revised edition. Confined to English\\nbiography, and to persons dead at the dale of publication of Supplement\\n(1909). The articles are full, and of the highest authority. In the\\nindex and epitome is a convenient summary of dates and facts.\\n\\nAPPLETON\\'S CYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN BIOGRAPHY Six volumes, 1887-1901; with\\nsupplement (unfinished), bringing it down to date.\\n\\nWHO\\'S WHO An annual publication; English, but with some American names;\\nliving persons only.\\n\\nWHO\\'S WHO IN AMERICA; WER IST\\'S; QUI ETES-VOUS Corresponding works for\\nAmerica, Germany, and France.\\n\\nDEBRETT\\'S PEERAGE A repository of a great mass of facts concerning\\nEnglish families of historical distinction.\\n\\n                         FOR CURRENT OR HISTORICAL FACTS\\n\\nTHE STATESMAN\\'S YEAR BOOK Arranged by countries; contains a great mass\\nof facts; has a bibliography at the end of each country or state.\\n\\nTHE WORLD ALMANAC; THE TRIBUNE ALMANAC Examples of annuals issued by\\nlarge newspapers, which contain an enormous mass of facts, chiefly\\nAmerican.\\n\\nWHITAKER\\'S ALMANAC Much miscellaneous information about the British\\nempire and other countries.\\n\\nTHE ANNUAL REGISTER; THE NEW INTERNATIONAL YEARBOOK; THE AMERICAN\\nYEARBOOK These three give information about the events of the preceding\\nyear.\\n\\nINDEX TO THE LONDON _Times_\\n\\nMISCELLANEOUS WORKS\\n\\nLIPPINCOTT\\'S NEW GAZETTEER A geographical dictionary of the world.\\n\\nTHE CENTURY ATLAS With classified references to places.\\n\\nTHE HANDY REFERENCE ATLAS Small size (octavo); a most useful book for\\nthe desk or library table.\\n\\nPLOETZ\\'S EPITOME OF UNIVERSAL HISTORY A very compact epitome of history,\\nwith all the important dates.\\n\\nNOTES AND QUERIES A periodical devoted to notes and queries on a\\nmultitude of curious and out-of-the-way facts; yearly index volumes are\\nissued.\\n\\nBIBLIOGRAPHIES ISSUED BY THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS\\n\\nSONNENSCHEIN\\'S THE BEST BOOKS A guide to about fifty thousand of the\\nbest available books in a great variety of fields, classified by\\nsubject.\\n\\nMake yourself familiar with all of these books which are within your\\nreach. Get into the habit, when you have a few minutes to spare, of\\ntaking them down from the shelves and turning over the pages to see what\\nthey contain. And whenever a question of fact comes up in general talk,\\nmake a mental note of it, or better, one in writing, and the next time\\nyou go to the library hunt it up in one of these reference books. You\\nwill be surprised to see, when once you have made the habit, how short a\\ntime it takes to settle disputes about most facts; and at the same time\\nyou will be extending your general knowledge.\\n\\nIn learning the use of these and other books, do not forget the most\\nimportant source of all, the librarian. The one guiding principle of\\nmodern librarianship is to make the books useful; and it gives every\\nproper librarian active pleasure to show you how to use the books in his\\ncharge.\\n\\nIn using books and magazines scrutinize the character of the source. Is\\nit impartial or partisan? Is its treatment of the subject exhaustive and\\ndefinite, or cursory and superficial? Does the author know the subject\\nat first hand, or does he rely on other men? On such points the second\\nbook or article will be easier to estimate than the first, and the third\\nthan the second; for with each new source you have the earlier ones as a\\nbasis for comparison. In any case do not trust to a single authority: no\\nmatter how authoritative it is, sooner or later the narrow basis of your\\nviews will betray itself, for an argument which is merely a revamping of\\nsome one else\\'s views is not likely to have much spontaneity.\\n\\nIn many subjects, and especially those of new or local interest, you\\nwill not find the facts gathered and assimilated for you; you must go\\nout and gather your own straw for the making of your bricks. Such are\\nmost questions of reform or change in school or college systems, in\\nathletics, in municipal affairs, in short, most of the questions on\\nwhich the average man after he leaves college is likely to be making\\narguments.\\n\\nTo get decisive facts on such questions as these you must go, in the\\ncase of local subjects, to the newspapers, to city and town reports, or\\nto documents issued by interested committees; for college questions you\\ngo to the presidents\\' reports and to annual catalogues or catalogues of\\ngraduates, or perhaps to _Graduates\\' Bulletins_ or _Weeklies_; for\\nathletic questions you go to the files of the daily newspapers, or for\\nrecords to such works as the _World_ or _Tribune Almanacs_; for school\\nquestions you go to school catalogues, or to school-committee reports.\\nYou will be surprised to find how little time you use to get together\\nbodies of facts and figures that may make you, in a small way, an\\noriginal authority on the subject you are discussing. It does not take\\nlong to count a few hundred names, or to run through the files of a\\nnewspaper for a week or a month; and when you have done such\\ninvestigation you get a sense of surety in dealing with your subject\\nthat will strengthen your argument. Here, as in the larger discussions\\nof later life, the readiness to take the initiative and the ingenuity in\\nthinking of possible sources are what make you count.\\n\\nSuch sources you can often piece out by personal inquiry from men who\\nare conversant with the subject--town or city officers, members of\\nfaculties, principals of schools. If you go to such people hoping that\\nthey will do your work for you, you will not be likely to get much\\ncomfort; but if you are keen about your subject yourself, and ready to\\nwork, you will often get not only valuable information and advice, but\\nsometimes also a chance to go through unpublished records. A young man\\nwho is working hard and intelligently is apt to be an object of interest\\nto older men who have been doing the same all their lives.\\n\\nEXERCISES\\n\\n1. Name those of the sources on pages 34-36, which are available to you.\\nReport to the class on the scope and character of each of them. (The\\nreport on different sources can be divided among the class.)\\n\\n2. Name some sources for facts relating to your own school or college;\\nto your own town or city; to your own state.\\n\\n3. Report on the following, in not more than one hundred words, naming\\nthe source from which you got your information: the situation and\\ngovernment of the Fiji Islands; Circe; the author of \"A man\\'s a man for\\na\\' that\"; Becky Sharp; the age of President Taft and the offices he has\\nheld; the early career of James Madison; the American amateur record in\\nthe half-mile run; the family name of Lord Salisbury, and a brief\\naccount of his career; the salary of the mayor of New York; the island\\nof Guam: some of the important measures passed by Congress in the\\nsession of 1910-1911. (This exercise a teacher can vary indefinitely by\\nturning over the pages of reference books which his class can reach; or\\nthe students can be set to making exercises for each other.)\\n\\n14. Bibliography. Before starting in earnest on the reading for your\\nargument, begin a bibliography, that is, a list of the books and\\narticles and speeches which will help you. This bibliography should be\\nentered in your notebook, and it is convenient to allow space enough\\nthere to keep the different kinds of sources separate. In making your\\nbibliography you will use some of the sources which have just been\\ndescribed, especially \"Poole\\'s Index,\" and \"The Reader\\'s Guide,\" and the\\nsubject catalogue of the library. Make your entries so full that you can\\ngo at once to the source; it is poor economy to save a minute on copying\\ndown a title, and then waste ten or fifteen in going back to the source\\nfrom which you got it. On large subjects the number of books and\\narticles is far beyond the possibilities of most courses in\\nargumentation, and here you must exercise your judgment in choosing the\\nmost important. The name of the author is on the whole a safe guide: if\\nyou find an article or a book by President Eliot on an educational\\nsubject, or one by President Hadley on economics, or one by President\\nJordan on zoology, or one by any of them on university policy, you will\\nknow at once that you cannot afford to neglect it. As you go on with\\nyour reading you will soon find who are authorities on special subjects\\nby noting who are quoted in text and footnotes. If the subject happens\\nto be one of those on which a bibliography has been issued either by the\\nLibrary of Congress or from some other source, the making of your own\\nbibliography will reduce itself to a selection from this list.\\n\\nKeep your bibliography as a practical aid to you in a very practical\\ntask. Do not swell it from mere love of accumulation, as you might\\ncollect stamps. The making of exhaustive bibliographies is work for\\nadvanced scholarship or for assistant librarians. For the practical\\npurposes of making an argument a very moderate number of titles beyond\\nthose you can actually use will give you sufficient background.\\n\\nNotebook. Enter in your notebook the titles of books, articles, or\\nspeeches which bear on your subject, and which you are likely to be able\\nto read.\\n\\nIllustration.

Before setting to work on the\\nactual planning of your argument there are still two preliminary\\nquestions you have to consider--the prepossessions of your audience, and\\nthe burden of proof; of these the latter is dependent on the former.\\n\\nWhen you get out into active life and have an argument to make, this\\nquestion of the audience will force itself on your attention, for you\\nwill not make the argument unless you want to influence views which are\\nactually held. In a school or college argument you have the difficulty\\nthat your argument will in most cases have no such practical effect.\\nNevertheless, even here you can get better practice by fixing on some\\nbody of readers who might be influenced by an argument on your subject,\\nand addressing yourself specifically to them. You can hardly consider\\nthe burden of proof or lay out the space which you will give to\\ndifferent points in your argument unless you take into account the\\npresent knowledge and the prepossessions of your audience on the\\nsubject.\\n\\nWhere the question is large and abstract the audience may be so general\\nas to seem to have no special characteristics; but if you will think of\\nthe differences of tone and attitude of two different newspapers in\\ntreating some local subject you will see that readers always segregate\\nthemselves into types. Even on a larger scale, one can say that the\\npeople of the United States as a whole are optimistic and self-confident\\nin temper, and in consequence careless as to many minor deficiencies and\\nblemishes in our national polity. On a good many questions the South,\\nwhich is still chiefly agricultural, has different interests and\\nprepossessions from the North; and the West, being a new country, is\\ninclined to have less reverence for the vested rights of property as\\nagainst the rights of men, than the Eastern states, where wealth has\\nlong been concentrated and inherited.\\n\\nAs one narrows down to the immediate or local questions which make the\\nbest subjects for practice the part played by the audience becomes more\\napparent. The reform of the rules of football is a good example: a few\\nyears ago an audience of elderly people would have taken for granted the\\nbrutality of the game, and its tendency to put a premium on unfair play;\\nthe rules committee, made up of believers in the game, had to be\\nhammered at for several years before they made the changes which have so\\ngreatly improved it. So in matters of local or municipal interest, such\\nas the location of a new street car line, or the laying out of a park,\\nit will make a vast difference to you whether you are writing for people\\nwho have land on the proposed line or park, or for the general body of\\ncitizens.\\n\\nDifferences in thy prepossessions of your audience and in their\\nknowledge of the subject have, therefore, a direct and practical effect\\non the planning of your argument. Suppose you are arguing in favor of\\nraising the standard of admission to your college; if your argument is\\naddressed to the faculty you will give little space to explaining what\\nthose requirements now are; but if you are sending out an address to the\\nalumni you must give some space to telling them clearly and without\\ntechnicalities what present conditions are and explaining the changes\\nthat you propose. Theoretically an argument should change in form and\\nproportions for every audience which you address. The theory may be\\npushed too far; but in the practice of real life it will be found nearly\\ntrue. With different audiences you will unconsciously make different\\nselection of material, and you will vary your emphasis, the place of\\nyour refutation, and the distribution of your space.\\n\\nNotebook. Enter the audience for whom your argument might be\\nwritten, and note what you think would be their knowledge of the\\nsubject, and their prepossessions toward it.\\n\\nIllustration. The citizens of Wytown. They are convinced that\\nthere should be a change in the city government; but they are not yet\\nfamiliar with the Des Moines plan.\\n\\n\\nEXERCISES\\n\\n1. Bring to class editorials from different newspapers on the same local\\nsubject, and point out differences of attitude which they assume in the\\naudiences they address.\\n\\n2. Suggest three different possible audiences for your argument, and\\nshow what differences you would make in your argument in addressing each\\nof them.\\n\\n\\n16. The Burden of Proof. The principle which underlies the\\nresponsibility for the burden of proof may be summed up in the adage of\\nthe common law, _He who asserts must prove_.\\n\\nAt the law this principle has been elaborated into a large and abstruse\\nsubject; in ordinary arguments where there is no judge to make subtle\\ndiscriminations, you must interpret it in the broadest way. The average\\nman lacks both the interest and the capacity for making keen\\ndistinctions; and when you are writing for him you would make a mistake\\nif you were to stickle for fine points concerning the burden of proof.\\n\\nIn general, the principle as it bears on the arguments of everyday life\\nimplies that any argument in favor of a change shall accept the burden\\nof proof. This application of the principle is illustrated in the\\nfollowing extract from an editorial article in _The Outlook_ some years\\nago, on a proposed change in the law of New York concerning the\\nsafeguards of vivisection.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe real question is not as to the merits of vivisection, but as to the\\nproper safeguards with which the law should surround it.\\n\\nAt present the law of New York state applies to experiments upon animals\\nthe same principle that it applies to surgical operations upon men,\\nwomen, and children. It does not attempt to prescribe the conditions\\nunder which either experiments or operations should be conducted; but it\\ndoes prescribe the standards of fitness which every person who may\\nlawfully engage in surgery and which every person who may lawfully\\nengage in animal experimentation must meet. It penalizes with fine or\\nimprisonment or both the unjustifiable injuring, mutilating, or killing\\nof animals; and it confines to regularly incorporated medical colleges\\nand universities of the state the authority under which animal\\nexperimentation may be conducted.\\n\\nThe burden of proof rests upon those who would have the state abandon\\nthis principle and substitute for it the principle of prescribing the\\nconditions of scientific investigation. It rests upon them to prove, in\\nthe first place, that the present law is inadequate. It is not\\nsufficient for them to produce lawyers who give opinions that the law\\nis not efficient. There are lawyers of the highest standing in the state\\nwho declare that it is efficient. The only adequate mode of proof would\\nbe by the prosecution of an actual abuse. So far as we have been able to\\nlearn, only one authentic case of alleged unjustifiable experimentation\\nhas been brought forward by the supporters of the bills. This is\\ncertainly not proof that the present law is inadequate.\\n\\nIn the second place, the burden of proof rests upon them to show that\\nlegal restrictions on the methods of science would not vitiate\\ninvestigations, and would not, therefore, entail upon human beings\\ngreater suffering than would otherwise be inflicted upon animals ...\\n\\nIt is because _The Outlook_ is convinced by overwhelming evidence that\\nthe practice of vivisection has not increased suffering but has rather\\nwidened immeasurably the merciful ministrations of medicine and surgery\\nthat it regards as dangerous unintelligent interference with\\nvivisection, and urges the maintenance of the principle underlying the\\npresent New York law.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nSo with other questions of policy, the burden of proof would be on any\\none who proposed a change from a policy long established, such as free\\ntrade in England, and to a less extent protection in this country, the\\nelective system in many American colleges, the amateur rule in school\\nand college athletics.\\n\\nAlways, one must remember that the burden of proof depends on the\\nprepossessions of the audience, and that on the same question it may\\nchange within a moderately small number of years. Ten years ago, on the\\nquestion of the popular election of senators the burden was clearly on\\nthe side of those who advocated a change in the Constitution. By this\\ntime (1912) the burden of proof has for a majority of the people of the\\nUnited States probably swung to the other side. In the state of Maine,\\nwhere prohibition had been embodied in the state constitution for a\\ngeneration, the burden of proof was on those who in 1911 argued for its\\nrepeal; whereas in Massachusetts, which has done well for many years\\nwith local option and high license, the burden would still be on those\\nwho should argue for state prohibition. In the discussions of the game\\nof football a few years ago the burden of proof before an audience of\\nathletes would have been on those who declared that the game must be\\nchanged; with college faculties and men of like mind the burden of proof\\nwould have been on those who defended the old game. In each case that\\ncomes up, you cannot place the burden of proof until you know whether\\nthe people you are trying to convince have any prepossessions in the\\nmatter: if they have, the burden of proof is on him who attempts to\\nchange those prepossessions; if they have not, the burden is on him who\\nis proposing to change existing views or existing policies.\\n\\nIn no case, however, with a popular audience is it very safe to depend\\nmuch on the burden of proof; almost always it is better to jump in and\\nactively build up the argument on your own side. In argument, as in\\nstrategy, take the offensive whenever you can.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nNotebook. Note whether the burden of proof is with you or against\\nyou, taking into account the probable prepossessions of the audience you\\nhave selected.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIllustration. In the argument for the introduction of the\\ncommission form of government into Wytown the burden of proof is on the\\naffirmative to show that the Des Moines plan of city government will\\ncure the evils of the present government of Wytown. With the audience\\nassumed (see p. 43), there is no burden of proof on the affirmative to\\nestablish the need of a change.\\n\\nEXERCISES\\n\\n\\n1. In three subjects which you might choose for an argument show where\\nthe burden of proof would lie.\\n\\n2. In the case of one of these arguments show how the burden of proof\\nmight change with the argument.\\n\\n17. The Brief. When you have settled these preliminary questions of\\nthe audience you wish to win over to your view, and of the way their\\nprepossessions and knowledge of the subject will affect your\\nresponsibilities for the burden of proof, you are ready to begin work on\\nthe brief, as the plan for an argument is called. This brief it is\\nbetter to think of as a statement of the logical framework of the\\nargument, which you are constructing for the purpose of clearing up your\\nown mind on the subject, and especially to help you to see how you can\\nmost effectively arrange your material. It differs from the usual brief\\nin a case at law in that the latter is ordinarily a series of compact\\nstatements of legal principles, each supported by a list of cases\\nalready decided which bear on that principle. The brief you will be\\nmaking now will consist of an _introduction_, which states whatever\\nfacts and principles are necessary to an understanding of the brief, and\\nthe _brief_ itself, which consists of a series of propositions, each\\nsupporting your main contention, and each in turn supported by others,\\nwhich again may each be supported by another series. Such an analysis\\nwill thoroughly display the processes of your reasoning, and enable you\\nto criticize them step by step for soundness and coerciveness.\\n\\nI shall first explain the several steps which go to the making of the\\nintroduction to the brief; and then come to the making of the brief\\nitself.\\n\\n18. The Proposition. The first step in making the introduction to your\\nbrief is to formulate the question or proposition (the two terms are\\ninterchangeable in practice). Until you have crystallized your view of\\nthe subject into a proposition you have nothing to argue about.\\n\"Commission form of government\" is a subject, but it is not arguable,\\nfor it gives you no hold either for affirming or denying. \"Commission\\ngovernment should be adopted in Wytown,\" or \"Commission government has\\nimproved political conditions in Des Moines,\" are both propositions\\nwhich are arguable (though not yet specific enough), for it is possible\\nto maintain either the affirmative or the negative of either of them.\\n\\nThe proposition must be single. If it be double, you have what the\\nlawyers call \"a squinting argument,\" that is, an argument which looks in\\ntwo directions at the same time. For example, the proposition,\\n\"Commission government would be a good thing for Wytown, but the\\ninitiative and referendum are wrong in principle,\" involves two separate\\nand unconnected principles, since commission government as first\\nembodied at Galveston does not include the initiative and referendum.\\nMany people, including those of Galveston and other places in Texas,\\nwould accept the first half of the proposition, and disagree with the\\nsecond half. On the other hand, \"Wytown should adopt a commission\\ngovernment on the Des Moines plan,\" would not be a double proposition,\\nthough this plan includes the initiative and referendum; for the\\nproposition makes the issue that the plan should be adopted or rejected\\nas a whole.\\n\\nIn some cases a proposition may be grammatically compound, and yet carry\\na single assertion. \"Municipal government by commission is more\\neconomical and efficient than municipal government with a mayor and two\\nchambers,\" is really a single assertion of the superiority of the\\ncommission plan of government. In this case there is no danger of\\ngetting into a split argument; but even here it is safer to reduce the\\nproposition to one which is grammatically single, \"Municipal government\\nby commission has proved itself superior to municipal government with a\\nmayor and two chambers.\" A predicate wholly single is a safeguard\\nagainst meaning two assertions.\\n\\nThe proposition must not be so abstract or vague in terms that you do\\nnot know whether you agree or disagree with it. Macaulay summed up this\\ndifficulty in one of his speeches in Parliament:\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nSurely my honorable friend cannot but know that nothing is easier than\\nto write a theme for severity, for clemency, for order, for liberty, for\\na contemplative life, for an active life, and so on. It was a common\\nexercise in the ancient schools of rhetoric to make an abstract\\nquestion, and to harangue first on one side and then on the other. The\\nquestion, Ought popular discontents to be quieted by concession or\\ncoercion, would have been a very good subject for oratory of this kind.\\nThere is no lack of commonplaces on either side. But when we come to the\\nreal business of life, the value of these commonplaces depends entirely\\non the particular circumstances of the case which we are discussing.\\nNothing is easier than to write a treatise proving that it is lawful to\\nresist extreme tyranny. Nothing is easier than to write a treatise\\nsetting forth the wickedness of wantonly bringing on a great society the\\nmiseries inseparable from revolution, the bloodshed, the spoliation, the\\nanarchy. Both treatises may contain much that is true; but neither will\\nenable us to decide whether a particular insurrection is or is not\\njustifiable without a close examination of the facts.[4]\\n\\nIn other words, though the word \"insurrection\" seems to be plain in\\nmeaning, yet when we make it one term of a judgment of which the other\\nterm is \"justifiable,\" we find that we do not know whether we agree or\\nnot. The terms of the proposition are so vague that there can be no\\nmeeting of minds. If we limit the subject to a specific case,\\ninsurrection in Venezuela, or insurrection in Cuba, then we have made a\\nbeginning toward making the proposition arguable. In these particular\\ncases, however, it would probably be necessary to go further, and\\nspecify which insurrection in Venezuela or in Cuba was intended, before\\nthe average American would be prepared either to affirm or to deny.\\nWherever the terms of a proposition are too vague to provoke profitable\\ndiscussion they must be narrowed down to a specific case which will draw\\nforth affirmation and denial.\\n\\nA common case where the vagueness of the proposition leads to\\ndifficulties in the argument is described in the following passage:\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAn equally common form of argument, closely allied to the argument by\\nanalogy, and equally vague, is that which is popularly known as the\\nobjection to a thin end of a wedge. We must not do this or that, it is\\noften said, because if we did we should be logically bound to do\\nsomething else which is plainly absurd or wrong. If we once begin to\\ntake a certain course there is no knowing where we shall be able to stop\\nwith any show of consistency; there would be no reason for stopping\\nanywhere in particular, and we should be led on, step by step, into\\naction or opinions that we all agree to call undesirable or untrue....\\n\\nFor it must not be forgotten that in all disputes of this kind there are\\ntwo parties opposed to each other, and that what divides them is\\nprecisely their lack of agreement on the question what principle is\\nreally involved. Those who see a proposal as a thin end of a wedge\\nalways see the principle as a wider, more inclusive one, than those who\\nmake the proposal; and what gives them freedom so to see it is merely\\nthe fact that it remains indefinite.[5]\\n\\nAs a practical example of this confusion, consider the following extract\\nfrom a speech in the United States Senate opposing the popular election\\nof senators:\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nEvery intelligent student of the present rapid trend toward popular\\ngovernment must see what would happen when this sentimental bar of the\\nStates being represented by two Senators instead of by the people in the\\nUnited States Senate is thrown down. The initiative, the referendum, and\\nthe recall are but symptoms of the times. That the people will have\\ntheir way, because they, and they alone, are the government, is the\\nunderlying spirit of our institutions, of our newest State\\nConstitutions, and of our progressive laws. Skillful agitation seizes\\nupon every pretext and eagerly grasps and enlarges every opportunity for\\nappeal to the passions in an advancement of its purposes. The next cry\\nwill necessarily be, \"Why not elect the Supreme Court of the United\\nStates by popular vote? Why not elect the Federal Judiciary everywhere\\nby popular vote?\"[6]\\n\\n       *       *    *       *       *\\n\\nHere the proposition, \"That the people will have their way, because\\nthey, and they alone, are the government, is the underlying spirit of\\nour institutions, of our newest state constitutions, and of our\\nprogressive laws,\" is not only obscure in terms, but it is wholly vague,\\nfor it does not define how far the progressive party propose to carry\\npopular direct government. Until the two sides agree on that point they\\nhave nothing definite enough for profitable argument.\\n\\nIt is surprising to notice how often in political debates this fallacy\\nis committed. It is human nature to believe for the time being that the\\nother side will do the worst thing that the circumstances make possible.\\nFortunately, human nature just as constantly refutes the error.\\n\\nTo make clearer this necessity of having a definite proposition to\\nargue, let us take one of the subjects suggested on page 10 which is not\\nyet in a form for profitable argument, and amend it. \"The standard for\\ngraduation from this college should be raised,\" is a subject that can be\\ndiscussed, but as it stands it would not be a good proposition for an\\nargument, because it is vague. How much should the standard be raised?\\nBy what method should it be raised? These and other questions you would\\nhave to answer before you would have a proposition definite enough to be\\nargued with profit. The proposition could be made definite enough by\\nsuch amendments as the following: \"The standard for graduation from this\\ncollege should be raised by requiring one eighth more hours of lecture\\nor recitation in each of the four years\"; or, \"The standard for\\ngraduation from this college should be raised by increasing the pass\\nmark in all courses from fifty per cent to sixty per cent\"; or, \"The\\nstandard for graduation from this college should be raised by allowing\\nno student to have his degree who has fallen below sixty per cent in one\\nfourth of his work, and has not attained eighty per cent in at least one\\neighth of his college work.\" In each of these cases the proposition is\\nso definite that you could find exactly how many students would be\\naffected. A proposition which involves a definite body of facts is\\narguable; one which involves an indefinite and incalculable body of\\nfacts is not.\\n\\nTo take another example from the brief we shall be working out in this\\nchapter, the proposition, \"Wytown should adopt the commission form of\\ngovernment,\" is not definite enough, for there are various forms of\\ncommission government, such as the Galveston plan, the Des Moines plan,\\nand by this time a considerable variety of others; and citizens who are\\nat all particular in their voting would want to know just which of these\\nwas proposed for their approval. The proposition, therefore, would have\\nto be limited to, \"Wytown should adopt a commission government after the\\nDes Moines plan.\"\\n\\nThe exact form of your proposition will not always come to you at the\\nfirst try. It may easily happen that you will not see the exact issue\\ninvolved in the argument until you have gone some way with the processes\\nof analysis which we shall be considering in the rest of this chapter.\\nAlways hold yourself ready to amend your proposition, if you can thereby\\ncome closer to the question.\\n\\nNotebook. Enter the exact proposition which you are to argue.\\n\\nIllustration. Wytown should adopt the commission form of\\ngovernment, in the form now in practice at Des Moines, Iowa.\\n\\nEXERCISES\\n\\n1. Make three arguable propositions on the subject, \"Entrance\\nexaminations for college.\"\\n\\n2. Criticize the following propositions and amend them, if necessary, so\\nthat they might be argued with profit:\\n\\n    a. Freshmen should be required to keep reasonable hours.\\n\\n    b. The honor system should be introduced everywhere.\\n\\n    c. This city should do more for its boys.\\n\\n    d. The street railway companies in this city should be better\\n    regulated.\\n\\n    e. The amateur rules for college athletes are too stringent.\\n\\n    f. Intercollegiate football is beneficial.\\n\\n\\n19. Definition of Terms. Making a proposition definite is chiefly\\na process of defining terms which are found in it; but when these are\\ndefined you may still in your argument use others which also need\\ndefinition. In general the definition of terms, whether in the\\nproposition or not, implies finding out just what a term means for the\\npresent purpose. Almost every common word is used for some variety of\\npurposes. \"Commission,\" for example, even within the field of\\ngovernment, has two very different meanings:\\n\\nAs applied to state and national administration, the term \"commission\\ngovernment\" is used in connection with the growing practice of\\ndelegating to appointed administrative boards or commissions--the\\nInterstate Commerce Commission, state railroad commissions, tax\\ncommissions, boards of control, etc.--the administration of certain\\nspecial or specified executive functions ...From the standpoint of\\norganization, then, \"commission government,\" as applied to the state,\\nconnotes decentralization, the delegation and division of authority and\\nresponsibility, and the disintegration of popular control ...As applied\\nto city administration, however, commission government has a very\\ndifferent meaning. In striking contrast to its use in connection with\\nthe state, it is used to designate the most concentrated and centralized\\ntype of organization which has yet appeared in the annals of\\nrepresentative municipal history. Under so-called commission government\\nfor cities, the entire administration of the city\\'s affairs is placed in\\nthe hands of a small board or council--\"commission\"--elected at large\\nand responsible directly to the electorate for the government of the\\ncity.[7]\\n\\nFurthermore, even the term \"commission government for cities\" is not\\nwholly definite, for there are already several recognized types of such\\ngovernment, such as the Galveston type, the Des Moines type, and recent\\nmodifications of these. If you are making an argument for introducing a\\ncommission government, therefore, you must go still further with your\\ndefinitions, and specify the distinguishing features of the particular\\nplan which you are urging on the voters, as is done in the definition on\\npage 59. In other words, you must make exactly clear the meaning of the\\nterm for the present case.\\n\\nYour first impulse when you find a term that needs defining may be to go\\nto a dictionary. A little thought will show you that in most cases you\\nwill get little comfort if you do. The aim of a dictionary is to give\\nall the meanings which a word has had in reasonable use; what you need\\nin an argument is to know which one of these meanings it has in the\\npresent case. If you were writing an argument on the effects or the\\nrighteousness of the change wrought in the English constitution by the\\nrecent curtailment of the veto power of the House of Lords, and wished\\nto use the word \"revolution,\" and to use it where it was important that\\nyour readers should understand precisely what you intended it to convey,\\nyou would not burden them with such a definition as the following, from\\nan unabridged dictionary: \"Revolution: a fundamental change in political\\norganization, or in a government or constitution; the overthrow or\\nrenunciation of one government and the substitution of another, by the\\ngoverned.\" Such a definition would merely fill up your space, and leave\\nyou no further ahead. A dictionary is studiously general, for it must\\ncover all possible legitimate meanings of the word; in an argument you\\nmust be studiously specific, to carry your readers with you in the case\\nunder discussion.\\n\\nMoreover, words are constantly being pressed into new uses, as in the\\ncase of \"commission\" (see p. 54); and others have entirely legitimate\\nlocal meanings. Only a dictionary which was on the scale of the New\\nEnglish Dictionary and which was reedited every five years could pretend\\nto keep up with these new uses. In an unabridged dictionary dated 1907,\\nfor example, the full definition of \"amateur\" is as follows: \"A person\\nattached to a particular pursuit, study or science, as to music or\\npainting; especially one who cultivates any study or art, from taste or\\nattachment, without pursuing it professionally.\" Of what use would such\\na definition be to you if you were arguing in favor of strengthening or\\nrelaxing the amateur rules in college athletics, in which you had to\\nfollow through the intricacies of summer baseball and of reimbursements\\nfor training table and traveling expenses? Such a definition hardly\\ncomes in sight of the use of the word which is most in the mouths of\\ncollege students in America. Words mean whatever careful and accepted\\nwriters have used them to mean; and the business of a dictionary is so\\nfar as possible to record these meanings. But language, being a living\\nand constantly developing growth, is constantly altering them and adding\\nto them.\\n\\nWhat a dictionary can do for you, therefore, is merely to tell you\\nwhether in the past the word has been used with the signification which\\nyou wish to give to it; but there are very few cases in which this will\\nbe much help to you, for in an argument your only interest in the\\nmeaning of a term is in the meaning of that term for the case under\\ndiscussion.\\n\\nThere are two quite different kinds of difficulty in putting the right\\ninterpretation on a statement, and a dictionary can only remove one of\\nthese, and by far the less important one. When you meet with a statement\\ncontaining an unfamiliar word--say, the word \"parallax,\" or\\n\"phanerogamous,\" or \"brigantine\"--and when you understand all the rest\\nof the statement except that word, then as a general rule the dictionary\\nwill help to make the meaning clear. But when the difficulty is caused,\\nnot by a word being unfamiliar, but by its being used in a certain\\ncontext, then the best dictionary in the world is, for your purpose, of\\nno use at all. The nature of every dictionary is necessarily such that\\nit entirely leaves out of account all doubts about meaning which are of\\nthis second kind. The most that a dictionary can do is to tell us the\\nmeaning of a word in those cases where the context in which it is used\\nis _not_ such as to make the meaning doubtful.[8]\\n\\nIn practice the words which most often need definition are those which\\nare, as it were, shorthand symbols for perhaps a very extensive meaning.\\nUnless the limits of this extended meaning are clearly marked out you\\ncannot tell whether the minds of your readers are, as the lawyers say,\\nrunning on all fours with your own or not. This extended meaning may be\\nof various sorts: for example, it may be a large general principle, as\\nin the case of \"evolution\" or \"culture\"; or it may be a general system\\nor practice, as in the case of \"commission government,\" \"honor system,\"\\nor \"high standards for graduation\"; or it may be a general class of\\nthings, persons, or events, as in the case of \"secondary school,\"\\n\"professional coach,\" or \"murder.\" When you use any such term in an\\nargument, it is essential that your readers shall have the same set of\\ndetails, ramifications, or instances in mind as you have yourself. For\\nthis purpose you must define the term; or, in other words, you must lay\\nout or display the ramifications and limitations of the principle, the\\ndetails of the system or practice, or the exact kinds of things,\\npersons, or events, which you have in mind when you use the term. A few\\nexamples will make this practical meaning of defining clear.\\n\\nSometimes the definition proceeds by careful and specific limitation of\\nthe general signification of a word, as in the following example from\\nBagchot:\\n\\n    I should say that except where it is explained to the contrary, I\\n    use the word \"toleration\" to mean toleration by law. Toleration by\\n    society of matters not subject to legal penalty is a kindred\\n    subject, on which if I have room I will add a few words; but in the\\n    main I propose to deal with the simpler subject, toleration by law.\\n    And by toleration, too, I mean, when it is not otherwise said,\\n    toleration in the public expression of opinions; toleration of acts\\n    and practices is another allied subject, on which I can, in a paper\\n    like this, but barely hope to indicate what seems to me to be the\\n    truth, and I should add that I deal only with the discussion of\\n    impersonal doctrines: the law of libel, which deals with accusations\\n    of living persons, is a topic requiring consideration by itself.[9]\\n\\nSometimes the definition is rather an unfolding and displaying of the\\nimplications (from the Latin, _implicare_, to fold in) of the term.\\nHuxley, near the beginning of his three \"Lectures on Evolution,\" made\\nsure by the following definition that his hearers should have a precise\\nidea of what he meant by the term \"evolution\":\\n\\nThe third hypothesis, or the hypothesis of evolution, supposes\\nthat, at any comparatively late period of past time, our imaginary\\nspectator would meet with a state of things very similar to that\\nwhich now obtains; but that the likeness of the past to the present\\nwould gradually become less and less, in proportion to the remoteness\\nof his period of observation from the present day; that\\nthe existing distribution of mountains and plains, of rivers and\\nseas, would show itself to be the product of a slow process of\\nnatural change operating upon more and more widely different\\nantecedent conditions of the mineral framework of the earth;\\nuntil, at length, in place of that framework, he would behold only\\na vast nebulous mass, representing the constituents of the sun and\\nof the planetary bodies. Preceding the forms of life which now\\nexist our observer would see animals and plants not identical with\\nthem, but like them; increasing their differences with their antiquity\\nand, at the same time, becoming simpler and simpler; until,\\nfinally, the world of life would present nothing but that undifferentiated\\nprotoplasmic matter, which, so far as our present knowledge\\ngoes, is the common foundation of all vital activity.\\n\\nThe hypothesis of evolution supposes that in all this vast progression\\nthere would be no breach of continuity, no point at which\\nwe could say, \"This is a natural process,\" and \"This is not a\\nnatural process,\" but that the whole might be compared to that\\nwonderful process of development which may be seen going on\\nevery day under our eyes, in virtue of which there arises, out of\\nthe semifluid, comparatively homogeneous substance which we\\ncall an egg, the complicated organization of one of the higher\\nanimals. That, in a few words, is what is meant by the hypothesis\\nof evolution.[10]\\n\\nHere Huxley has laid out, in compact form the principal ramifications of\\nthe great principle of evolution, giving his hearers something like an\\noutline map of it with its limits and principal divisions.\\n\\nWhere you have a practice or system to define, you will be more likely\\nto do it by specifying the chief and essential details of the system, as\\nin the following definition of commission government for cities. It will\\nbe noticed that this narrows down the meaning of the term to something\\nlike the Des Moines system, as distinguished from the Galveston plan.\\n\\nA straight commission form of municipal government, in the judgment of\\nDr. Charles W. Eliot, one of its most active advocates, requires a\\ncommission composed of five members elected at large, one of whom is\\ncalled the mayor, acting as chairman of the commission, but with no\\nveto power, or any other special power not shared by the other members\\nof the commission.\\n\\nThe commission so elected is the source of all authority in the city,\\nmakes all ordinances, appoints all officials, collects taxes, and makes\\nall appropriations. As set forth by its advocates, the significant\\nfeatures of the plan, in addition to those already mentioned, are:\\n\\nAssignment of the important divisions of the city government to\\nindividual members of the commission, or their election thereto by the\\nvoters, each being directly responsible for the conduct of his\\nparticular department; adequate compensation to the commissioners for\\ntheir time and labor, the city employing all the commissioners at living\\nsalaries, thus elevating the dignity of municipal service and making it\\na public career, and not a mere avocation; regularity, frequency, and\\npublicity of the meetings of the commissioners; all employees above the\\nclass of day laborers selected from eligible lists based on\\nexaminations, oral and written, carefully devised to develop merit and\\nfitness; recommendations after examination by an independent civil\\nservice commission; provision for the retention in office of all\\nemployees so appointed during good behavior; the power to initiate\\nlegislation reserved to the people, this right being known as the\\ninitiative; the power to call for a public vote on any measure adopted\\nby the commission before being given effect as law reserved to the\\npeople, this being known as the referendum; the power at any time to\\nmake any member of the commission stand for reelection reserved to the\\npeople, this being known as the recall; the granting of public franchise\\nalways to be submitted to the approval of the electors.\\n\\nThere are two other important features: the introduction of the\\nprinciple of the short ballot and the elimination of ward lines. In the\\nmatured judgment of municipal students these are considered, together\\nwith the concentration of authority, as the most effective features of\\nthe system.[11]\\n\\nHere is a pretty complete display of all the essential details of the\\nsystem which the author of this definition intended to mean by the term\\n\"commission government for cities.\"\\n\\nWhere the term which is to be defined is the name of a general class,\\nwhether of persons, things, or events, the definition must show just\\nwhat persons, things, or events are to be included under the term for\\nthe present purpose. Lincoln gave a famous example of this sort of\\ndefinition in the opening of his address at Cooper Institute, February\\n27, 1860. He took for the text of the first part of his speech a\\nstatement of Senator Douglas.\\n\\nIn his speech last autumn at Columbus, Ohio, as reported in the New York\\n_Times_, Senator Douglas said, \"Our fathers, when they framed the\\ngovernment under which we live, understood this question just as well,\\nand even better, than we do now.\"\\n\\nI fully indorse this, and I adopt it as a text for this discourse. I so\\nadopt it because it furnishes a precise and an agreed starting point for\\na discussion between Republicans and that wing of the Democracy headed\\nby Senator Douglas. It simply leaves the inquiry: What was the\\nunderstanding those fathers had of the question mentioned?\\n\\nWhat is the frame of government under which we live? The answer must be,\\n\"The Constitution of the United States.\" That Constitution consists of\\nthe original, framed in 1787, and under which the present government\\nfirst went into operation, and twelve subsequently framed amendments,\\nthe first ten of which were framed in 1789.\\n\\nWho were our fathers that framed the Constitution? I suppose the\\n\"thirty-nine\" who signed the original instrument may be fairly called\\nour fathers who framed that part of the present government. It is almost\\nexactly true to say they framed it, and it is altogether true to say\\nthey fairly represented the opinion and sentiment of the whole nation at\\nthat time. Their names being familiar to nearly all, and accessible to\\nquite all, need not now be repeated. I take these \"thirty-nine,\" for\\nthe present, as being \"our fathers who framed the government under which\\nwe live.\" What is the question which, according to the text, those\\nfathers understood \"just as well, and even better, than we do now\"?\\nIt is this: Does the proper division of local from Federal authority, or\\nanything in the Constitution, forbid our Federal Government to control\\nas to slavery in our Federal Territories?\\n\\nUpon this, Senator Douglas holds the affirmative, and Republicans the\\nnegative. This affirmation and denial form an issue; and this\\nissue--this question--is precisely what the text declares our fathers\\nunderstood \"better than we.\"\\n\\nLet us now inquire whether the \"thirty-nine,\" or any of them, ever acted\\nupon this question; and if they did, how they acted upon it--how they\\nexpressed that better understanding.\\n\\nHere as will be seen, Lincoln took every important word and phrase, and\\nshowed exactly what persons and things were included under them. Then he\\nwent ahead with his argument with the assurance that his audience and he\\nwere treading the same path.\\n\\nSomewhat similar are the definitions in many cases at law, where the\\nissue is whether the agreed facts in a case come under a certain term or\\nnot. The Constitution of the United States provides that \"direct taxes\"\\nshall be apportioned among the states in proportion to their population,\\nbut makes no such restriction on the levying of \"duties,\" \"imposts,\" and\\n\"taxes.\" When Congress establishes a new form of tax, therefore, such as\\nthe income tax or the corporation tax, the Supreme Court is pretty sure\\nto be called on to decide under which of these large constitutional\\nclasses it falls. In such cases as the Income Tax cases, which decided\\nthat the income tax laid in the Act of 1904 was unconstitutional, and in\\nthe Corporation Tax cases, which upheld the Act of 1909, both the\\narguments of counsel and the decision of the court deal wholly with the\\ndefinition of the term \"direct tax.\" Here the definition takes the form\\nof an examination of previous cases which involved the term, to see\\nwhether the present case is like those that have been held to be within\\nit, or like those which have been held to fall outside it. From this\\ncomparison of the two sets of cases the essential characteristics of the\\ndirect tax are brought to the surface.\\n\\nA good example of the careful distinctions which must be made in\\ndefining a legal term is found in Daniel Webster\\'s famous argument in\\nthe White Murder Case, of which an extract will be found below. The\\nquestion here is just how far the term \"murder\" shall be extended.\\n\\nThere are two sorts of murder; the distinction between them it is of\\nessential importance to bear in mind: (1) murder in an affray, or upon\\nsudden and unexpected provocation; (2) murder secretly, with a\\ndeliberate, predetermined intention to commit the crime. Under the first\\nclass, the question usually is, whether the offense he murder or\\nmanslaughter, in the person who commits the deed. Under the second\\nclass, it is often a question whether others than he who actually did\\nthe deed were present, aiding and assisting therein. Offenses of this\\nkind ordinarily happen when there is nobody present except those who go\\non the same design. If a riot should happen in the court-house, and one\\nshould kill another, this may be murder, or it may not, according to the\\nintention with which it was done; which is always matter of fact, to be\\ncollected from the circumstances at the time. But in secret murders,\\npremeditated and determined on, there can be no doubt of the murderous\\nintention; there can be no doubt if a person be present, knowing a\\nmurder is to be done, of his concurring in the act. His being there is a\\nproof of his intent to aid and abet; else, why is he there?\\n\\nIt has been contended, that proof must be given that the person accused\\ndid actually afford aid, did lend a hand in the murder itself; and\\nwithout this proof, although he may be near by, he may be presumed to be\\nthere for an innocent purpose; he may have crept silently there to hear\\nthe news, or from mere curiosity to see what was going on. Preposterous,\\nabsurd! Such an idea shocks all common sense. A man is found to be a\\nconspirator to commit a murder; he has planned it; he has assisted in\\narranging the time, the place, and the means; and he is found in the\\nplace, and at the time, and yet it is suggested that he might have been\\nthere, not for cooperation and concurrence, but from curiosity! Such an\\nargument deserves no answer. It would be difficult to give it one, in\\ndecorous terms. Is it not to be taken for granted, that a man seeks to\\naccomplish his own purposes? When he has planned a murder, and is\\npresent at its execution, is he there to forward or to thwart his own\\ndesign? Is he there to assist, or there to prevent? But \"curiosity\"! He\\nmay be there from mere \"curiosity\"! Curiosity to witness the success of\\nthe execution of his own plan of murder! The very walls of a court-house\\nought not to stand, the plowshare should run through the ground it\\nstands on, where such an argument could find toleration.\\n\\nIt is not necessary that the abettor should actually lend a hand, that\\nhe should take a part in the act itself; if he be present ready to\\nassist, that is assisting.... The law is, that being ready to assist is\\nassisting, if the party has the power to assist, in case of need. It is\\nso stated by Foster, who is a high authority. \"If A happeneth to be\\npresent at a murder, for instance, and taketh no part in it, nor\\nendeavoreth to prevent it, nor apprehendeth the murderer, nor levyeth\\nhue and cry after him, this strange behavior of his, though highly\\ncriminal, will not of itself render him either principal or accessory.\"\\n\"But if a fact amounting to murder should be committed in prosecution of\\nsome unlawful purpose, though it were but a bare trespass, to which A in\\nthe case last stated had consented, and he had gone in order to give\\nassistance, if need were, for carrying it into execution, this would\\nhave amounted to murder in him, and in every person present and joining\\nwith him.\" \"If the fact was committed in prosecution of the original\\npurpose which was unlawful, the whole party will be involved in the\\nguilt of him who gave the blow. For in combinations of this kind, the\\nmortal stroke, though given by one of the party, is considered in the\\neye of the law, and of sound reason too, as given by every individual\\npresent and abetting. The person actually giving the stroke is no more\\nthan the hand or instrument by which the others strike.\" The author, in\\nspeaking of being present, means actual presence; not actual in\\nopposition to constructive, for the law knows no such distinction. There\\nis but one presence, and this is the situation from which aid, or\\nsupposed aid, may be rendered. The law does not say where the person is\\nto go, or how near he is to go, but that he must be where he may give\\nassistance, or where the perpetrator may believe that he may be assisted\\nby him. Suppose that he is acquainted with the design of the murderer,\\nand has a knowledge of the time when it is to be carried into effect,\\nand goes out with a view to render assistance, if need be; why, then,\\neven though the murderer does not know of this, the person so going out\\nwill be an abettor in the murder.\\n\\n20. Definition through the History of the Case. In some cases the\\neasiest way to put before your readers the precise details or\\nlimitations implied in a term is through a brief review of the history\\nof the question. In the Lincoln-Douglas debates Lincoln was constantly\\nshowing that Douglas\\'s use of the term \"popular sovereignty\" must be\\nunderstood in the light of the whole history of the slavery question;\\nthat it meant one thing--what Douglas intended it to mean--if the\\nhistory of the question before 1850 were left out of sight; but that it\\nmeant a wholly different thing if the steady encroachment of the slave\\npower from the Missouri Compromise of 1820 on were taken into account.\\nAnd Lincoln showed that in reality \"popular sovereignty\" had come to\\nmean a power oh the part of the people of a territory to introduce\\nslavery, but not to exclude it.[12] In our own day \"progressive\" has a\\ndifferent meaning when applied to a Republican from Kansas and to one\\nfrom Massachusetts or New York.\\n\\nTo know just what is involved by applying the term to any given public\\nman, one must go back to the recent history of his party in his own\\nstate, and to the speeches he has made. In political discussions popular\\nphrases are constantly thus blurred in meaning through being used as\\nparty catchwords; and to use them with any certainty in an argument one\\nmust thus go back to their origin, and then dissect out, as it were, the\\nambiguous implications which have grown into them.\\n\\nIf you were arguing any question concerning the elective system or the\\nentrance requirements for your own college, you would often do well to\\nsketch the history of the present system as a means of defining it,\\nbefore you go on to urge that it be changed or kept as it is. So if you\\nwere arguing for a further change in the football rules, your best\\ndefinition of the present game for your purpose would be a sketch of the\\nway in which the game has been changed in the past few years, at the\\nurgent demand of public opinion. Such a sketch you could easily get by\\nrunning through the back numbers of such a magazine as _Outing_, or the\\nsporting columns of some of the larger weeklies. Or again, if you were\\narguing that the street railway systems of your city should be allowed\\nto combine, your best description or definition of the present situation\\nmight well be a sketch of the successive steps by which it came to be\\nwhat it is. Here you would go for your material to the files of local\\nnewspapers, or, if you could get at them, to sets of the reports of the\\nrailway companies.\\n\\nThe definition of terms through the history of the question has the\\nadvantage that, besides helping your readers to see why the terms you\\nuse have the meaning you give them for the present case, it also makes\\nthem better judges of the question by giving them a full background.\\n\\nAmbiguous definitions, which do not distinguish between two or more\\nmeanings of a term for the case under discussion, are usually avoided by\\ngoing back to the history of the case. In Chapter III we shall consider\\nmore fully the fallacies which spring from ambiguous use of words. Here\\nI shall insist briefly on the necessity of searching into the way terms\\nhave come to be used in specific discussions.\\n\\nThe first of these is the danger which arises when a word in general use\\ntakes on a special, almost technical meaning in connection with a\\nparticular subject. Here you must take some pains to see that your\\nreaders understand it in the special sense, and not in the popular one.\\nA crass instance, in which there is little real possibility of\\nconfusion, is the use of words like \"democratic\" or \"republican\" as the\\nnames of political parties; even with these words stump speakers\\nsometimes try to play on the feelings of an uneducated audience by\\nimporting the association of the original use of the word into its later\\nuse. There are a good many words used in the scientific study of\\ngovernment which are also used loosely in general talk. \"Federal\" has a\\nprecise meaning when used to distinguish the form of government of the\\nUnited States from that which usually binds together the counties in a\\nstate; but we constantly use it in a sense hardly distinguishable from\\nthat of \"National.\" The following extract from an editorial on the\\nPhilippine question is a good illustration of this precise and\\nsemitechnical use of words, and the loose, not very accurate use of\\neveryday speech:\\n\\nOn the other hand, it is said that this policy of the United States\\ntoward its dependencies is insincere; that it is a covert plan of\\nexploitation; that, as it is practiced, it is a denial in act of a mere\\npromise to the ear; and that if it were genuine the United States would\\nbestow self-government upon its dependencies by granting independence.\\n\\nThis criticism is obviously based on a confusion of independence with\\nself-government. Russia, is independent, but in only a very slight\\ndegree are its people self-governing. Turkey has long been independent,\\nbut until the recent revolution the people of Turkey were self-governing\\nin no sense at all. On the other hand, Canada, though not independent,\\nis self-governing.[13]\\n\\nMany an argument goes to wreck through carelessness in the use of words\\nof this sort. Wherever the subject under discussion has grown into the\\npartial possession of a special field, but still uses words drawn from\\neveryday life, you must be careful that not only you, but your audience\\nalso, understand your terms in the more precise way.\\n\\nClosely related to this kind of ambiguity, and in practice still more\\ninsidious, is the ambiguity which arises from the connotation or\\nemotional implications of words. The use of \"republican\" and \"democrat\"\\ncited above runs over into this kind of confusion. In collegiate\\nathletics \"professional\" has come to have almost an implication of\\nmoral inferiority, when it is often dependent on pretty technical\\nconsiderations of expediency. In politics, to one class of temperaments\\n\"conservative,\" to another \"radical,\" or at any rate \"liberal\" or\\n\"progressive,\" carries the implication of the salvation or the ruin of\\nthe country. All such words introduce a sure element of obscurity and\\nconfusion into an argument. If a word stirs your feelings in one way and\\nthose of some of your readers in another, you cannot use that word\\nsafely; in spite of the most careful definitions and disclaimers the\\nemotional bias will creep in and twist the effect of your words in the\\nminds of some of your audience. This emotional ambiguity is the most\\ninsidious of all ambiguities in the use of words. The danger from it is\\nso real that I shall return to it at greater length (see p. 158).\\n\\nIn a good many cases the necessity of defining the terms to be used,\\nwhether in the proposition itself, or in the argument, changes with the\\naudience. If you begin a movement to introduce a commission form of\\ngovernment into the town or the city in which you live, at first you\\nwill have to repeat the definition of commission government a good many\\ntimes, in order that most of the voters may know exactly what you want\\nthem to do. If the town once wakes up, however, and gets interested, you\\nand every one else will be using such technicalities as \"Galveston\\nplan,\" \"Des Moines plan,\" \"recall,\" \"initiative,\" and the like with no\\ndanger of leaving darkness where there should be light.\\n\\nSo even more obviously with school and college questions: if you are\\nsending memorials urging the introduction of the honor system or of\\nstudent self-government, one to the trustees of your college, and\\nanother to the faculty, and at the same time addressing an appeal to\\nyour fellow students through a college paper, in each of the three cases\\nyour definitions might differ. You could probably assume that both\\nstudents and faculty would be more or less familiar with the question,\\nso that your definitions would be of the nature of precise\\nspecifications of the plan you were urging. With the trustees your\\ndefinitions would probably have to be longer and your explanations more\\ndetailed, for such a body would start with only a vague knowledge of the\\nsituation.\\n\\nAs in all other steps in making an argument, so in defining, there is\\nno formula for all cases. In each case your knowledge of your audience\\nmust guide you, and your own sagacity. Unnecessary definitions will make\\nthem think you a prig; insufficient definition will let them stray away\\nfrom your meaning.\\n\\nNotebook. Enter any terms which need definition for the\\naudience you are addressing.\\n\\nIllustration. Commission form of government after the Des Mouses\\nplan. The essential features of this plan are as follows: The entire\\naffairs of the city are conducted by a mayor and four councilors,\\nelected at large for two years; they are nominated at a primary\\nelection; at neither primary nor final election are party designations\\nallowed on the ballot; these officers are subject to the recall; the\\nmayor is chairman of the council, but has no power of veto; the\\nexecutive and administrative powers are divided into five departments,\\neach under the charge of a member of the council--(1) public affairs\\n(under the charge of the mayor), (2) accounts and finances, (3)public\\nsafety,(4) streets and public improvements, (5) parks and public\\nproperty; all other offices are filled and their duties prescribed by\\nmajority vote of the council; recall; grants of franchises must be\\napproved by popular vote; initiative and referendum; a summary of city\\naffairs must be published and distributed once a month.\\n\\nRecall, On petition of twenty-five per cent of the voters at the last\\nelection the mayor or any of the councilmen must stand for reelection at\\na special election.\\n\\nReferendum. On petition of twenty-five per cent of the voters any\\nordinance must be submitted to popular vote at a special election; no\\nordinance goes into effect until ten days after being passed by the\\ncouncil.\\n\\nInitiative.

Your preparation for your argument should now\\nhave given you a clear idea of the interests and prepossessions of your\\nreaders, it should have left you with a definite proposition to support\\nor oppose, and it should have made you sure of the meaning of all the\\nterms you are to use, whether in the proposition or in your argument.\\nThe next step in working out the introduction to your brief is to note\\ndown the chief points that can be urged on the two sides of the\\nquestion, as direct preparation for the final step, which will be to\\nfind the main issues. These main issues are the points on which the\\ndecision of the whole question will turn. They will vary in number with\\nthe case, and to some extent with the space which you have for your\\nargument. In a question of fact, which turns on circumstantial evidence,\\nthere may be a number of them. In the White Murder Case, in which as we\\nhave already seen, Webster was the chief counsel for the prosecution, he\\nsummed up the main issues in the following passage. The essential facts\\nneeded to understand the case are that the defendant was Franklin Knapp,\\nthat his sister-in-law, Mrs. Joseph Knapp, was the niece of Captain\\nWhite, that by removing and destroying the will of Captain White the\\ndefendant and his brother Joseph supposed that they had made sure that\\nshe would inherit from him a large sum of money, that Richard\\nCrowninshield, the actual perpetrator of the murder, had killed himself\\nin prison. To convince the jury of the guilt of the prisoner, Webster\\nhad to carry them with him on the following seven main issues:\\n\\n    Gentlemen, I have gone through with the evidence in this case, and\\n    have endeavored to state it plainly and fairly before you. I think\\n    there are conclusions to be drawn from it, the accuracy of which you\\n    cannot doubt.\\n\\n    I think you cannot doubt that there was a conspiracy formed fur the\\n    purpose of committing this murder, and who the conspirators were:\\n\\n    That you cannot doubt that the Crowninshields and the Knapps were\\n    the parties in this conspiracy:\\n\\n    That you cannot doubt that the prisoner at the bar knew that the\\n    murder was to be done on the night of the 6th of April:\\n\\n    That you cannot doubt that the murderers of Captain White were the\\n    suspicious persons seen in and about Brown Street on that night:\\n\\n    That you cannot doubt that Richard Crowninshield was the perpetrator\\n    of that crime:\\n\\n    That you cannot doubt that the prisoner at the bar was in Brown\\n    Street on that night.\\n\\n    If there, then it must be by agreement, to countenance, to aid the\\n    perpetrator. And if so, then he is guilty as \"Principal.\"\\n\\nSimilarly, in most arguments of policy there are a number of\\nconsiderations that converge in favor of or against the proposed policy.\\nIf you were writing an argument in favor of keeping the study of Latin\\nin the commercial course of a high school, you would probably urge that\\nLatin is essential for an effective knowledge of English, that it is the\\nfoundation of Spanish and French, languages which will be of constantly\\nincreasing importance to American business men in the future, and that\\nyoung men and women who go into business have an even stronger right to\\nstudies which will enlarge their horizons and open their minds to purely\\ncultivating influences than those who go on to college. Indeed, in very\\nfew questions of policy which are doubtful enough to need argument is\\nthere any single consideration on which the whole case will turn. Human\\naffairs are much complicated by cross interests, and many influences\\nmodify even one\\'s everyday decisions.\\n\\nTo find the main issues--which are really the critical ones on which\\nyour audience will make up their minds--is a matter largely of native\\nsagacity and penetration; but thorough knowledge of your whole subject\\nis essential if you are to strike unerringly to the heart of the subject\\nand pick out these pivotal points.\\n\\nA simple and very practical device for getting at the main issues is to\\nput down on paper the chief points which might be made on the two sides.\\nThen with these before you, you can soon, by stating them and\\nrearranging them, simmer down your case into arguable form.\\n\\nIn the argument on introducing a commission form of government into\\nWytown this noting down of the chief points which might be urged on the\\ntwo sides would be about as follows:\\n\\nContentions on the Two Sides. On the affirmative the following points\\nmight be urged:\\n\\n    1. The plan would make the individuals who hold the power directly\\n    responsible at all times to the citizens.\\n\\n    2. It would make the responsibility for all municipal action easy to\\n    trace.\\n\\n    3. It would get abler men to serve the city.\\n\\n    4. It would take municipal government out of politics.\\n\\n    5. It would hold municipal administration up to the same standards\\n    of honesty and efficiency as private business.\\n\\n    6. It would make it difficult to elect representatives of corrupt\\n    interests.\\n\\n    7. It would make possible advantageous dealings with public-service\\n    corporations.\\n\\n    8. It would make possible the immediate removal of an unfaithful\\n    official.\\n\\n    9. It would tend to interest the citizens intelligently in municipal\\n    affairs.\\n\\n    10. It has worked well wherever it has been tried.\\n\\nOn the negative side the following points might be urged:\\n\\n    1. The plan is a complete departure from the traditional American\\n    theory of government.\\n\\n    2. It throws away a chance for training in public affairs for a\\n    considerable body of young men.\\n\\n    3. It might put very great power in the hands of unworthy men.\\n\\n    4. Corrupt interests, having a larger stake, would work harder to\\n    control the city.\\n\\n    5. Past experience gives no reason to expect the constant interest\\n    on the part of citizens which is necessary to make so great\\n    concentration of power safe.\\n\\n    6. With further increase in the foreign population of the city there\\n    will be danger from race and religious clannishness.\\n\\n    7. A return to the old-fashioned town government, or some such\\n    modification of it as has been tried at Newport, would enlist the\\n    active interest of more citizens.\\n\\n    8. The system is still an experiment.\\n\\n    9. The present success of the plan in various places is largely to\\n    be ascribed to its novelty.\\n\\n    10. The present system has in the past given good government.\\n\\n    11. The liability to recall will keep public officials from\\n    initiating advantageous policies if they would be detrimental to\\n    part of the city, or if they were unpopular because of novelty.\\n\\nIn most cases, as here, you will get too many points to argue out in the\\nspace which is at your disposal. Fifteen hundred or two thousand words\\nare very soon eaten up when you begin to state evidence in any detail,\\nand arguments written in school or college can rarely be longer. You\\nmust look forward, therefore, to not more than four or five main issues.\\nIn going over and comparing the points which you have jotted down in\\nthis preliminary statement you must consequently be prepared to throw\\nout all that are not obviously important. Even when you have done this\\nyou will usually have more than enough points left to fill your space,\\nand must make some close decisions before you get at those which you\\nfinally decide to argue out.\\n\\nYou must also be prepared to rephrase and remold some of the points in\\norder to get at the most important aspects of the case. This noting down\\nof the points which might be urged you should therefore regard entirely\\nas a preliminary step, and not as fixing the points in the form in which\\nyou will argue them out.\\n\\nIn the main issues for the argument on introducing commission government\\ninto Wytown, as they are worked out below, it will be seen that main\\nissue 4 for the affirmative is derived in part from the points marked\\n1, 2, 6, and 8 of those for the affirmative, and those marked 3, 4, and\\n5 for the negative.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is obvious that the main issues you choose will vary\\nsomewhat with the side of the question which you are arguing. You will\\nalmost surely have to leave out some of the points which might be urged,\\nand there is no sense in letting the other side choose your ground for\\nyou. Points which from one side may be of no great consequence, or not\\nvery practicable to argue, may on the other be highly effective; and in\\narguing you should always take what advantage can fairly be gained from\\nposition.\\n\\nThe phrasing of the main issues, too, will vary with the side on which\\nyou are arguing them. Here, again, you must take every fair advantage\\nthat is to be gained from position. In the main issues of the question I\\nhave been using for an example, as they are stated below, it will be\\nseen that main issue 1 on the affirmative and main issue 3 on the\\nnegative cover very nearly the same ground; but if you were arguing on\\nthe affirmative you would direct attention to the shortcomings inherent\\nin the system of government, if on the negative, to the temporary and\\nremovable causes of them. Whichever side you were arguing on there is no\\nreason that you should lose the advantage of so phrasing the issue that\\nyou can go directly to your work of establishing your contention.\\n\\nIn the argument on introducing commission government into Wytown the\\nmain issues might be as follows:\\n\\nThe main issues as chosen by the affirmative:\\n\\n    1. Is the admitted inefficiency of the city government at present\\n    due to the system of government?\\n\\n    2. Will the adoption of the plan result in more economical\\n    administration?\\n\\n    3. Will the adoption of the plan result in more efficient service\\n    to the city?\\n\\n    4. Will the direct responsibility of the mayor and councilors to the\\n    citizens be a sufficient safeguard for the increased power given to\\n    them?\\n\\nThe main issues as chosen by the negative:\\n\\n    1. Is there danger in putting such large powers into the hands of so\\n    few men?\\n\\n    2. Will the new plan, if adopted, permanently raise the standard of\\n    public servants?\\n\\n    3. Is the inefficiency of the city government at present due to\\n    temporary and removable causes?\\n\\n    4. Has the plan succeeded in other places largely because of its\\n    novelty?\\n\\n    5. Will the liability to recall keep officials from initiating new\\n    policies for fear of unpopularity?\\n\\nIn some cases it will be hard to reduce the number of issues to a\\nmanageable number; in others, for special reasons, it may be possible to\\ntreat a part of them only at length. In such cases one can always adopt\\nthe device of an imaginary \"next chapter\" or \"to be continued in our\\nnext.\" In considering how many issues you can deal with satisfactorily,\\nhowever, you must not leave out of account contentions on the other side\\nthat must be refuted; and in choosing among the possible main issues you\\nmust always exercise judgment. Many points which might be argued are not\\nworth the space it would take to deal with them; but not infrequently\\nyou will have to let points that have some weight give place to others\\nthat have more.\\n\\nIt is not to be expected that the points made by the two sides will\\nalways exactly pair off, for the considerations which make for a course\\nof action may be different in kind from those which make against it.\\nSometimes one side will contribute more to the final number of main\\nissues, sometimes the other. Ordinarily your own side will give you the\\nlarger number of points that you think worth arguing out, for an\\naffirmative and constructive argument usually makes more impression than\\na negative one.\\n\\nNotebook. Enter the chief points which might be made on the two sides\\nof your question. Then, after studying them and comparing them, enter\\nthe main issues which you decide to argue out.\\n\\n(The contentions on the two sides and the main issues for the model\\nargument will be found on pages 74-77.)\\n\\n\\nEXERCISE\\n\\n\\nTake one of the questions on pages 10-12, with which you have some\\nacquaintance, and obtain the main issues by noting down first the points\\nwhich might be urged on the two sides.\\n\\nNOTE. This exercise is a good one for class work. Let the class suggest\\nthe points, and write them, as they come, on the blackboard. Then call\\nfor criticism and discussion of them, in order to come to the main\\nissues.\\n\\n\\n22. The Agreed Statement of Facts. Now that you have compared the points\\non which the two sides disagree, you can pick out the points on which\\nthey agree, and decide which of the latter will enter into the\\ndiscussion. You are therefore in a position to draw up the agreed\\nstatement of facts, in which you will sum up compactly so much of the\\nhistory of the case, of the origin of the present question, and other\\nrelevant facts and necessary definitions, as will be needed to\\nunderstand the brief. The style of this statement should be strictly\\nexpository, and there should be nothing in it to which both sides could\\nnot agree. It should be similar to the statements of facts in courts of\\nlaw, which are sent up with the briefs when a case is appealed on a\\npoint of legal principle.\\n\\nSince this agreed statement of facts is not argument, it will make small\\nuse of such conjunctions as \"because,\" \"for,\" \"hence,\" and \"therefore.\"\\nIf you find any of them in your agreed statement, it is better to\\nrearrange it, so that you will not seem to be giving reasons before you\\nhave begun your argument.\\n\\nIn the making of this preliminary statement and to a certain extent in\\nthe framing of the main issues, it is convenient and advisable,\\nwherever both sides of the question are to be presented in arguments,\\nwhether in writing or in debate, for the two parties to work together.\\nIn this working together they should aim to agree on as many points as\\npossible. If they meet in a carping and unyielding temper, the result\\nwill be in the end that the patience of the audience will be tried and\\nits attention dispersed by lengthy arguments on preliminary details. In\\nmaking an argument one should never forget, even in school and college\\nwork, that the aim of all argument is to produce agreement. Few people\\nhave much interest in a contest in smartness; and it is a bad habit to\\ncare too much about the mere beating of an opponent on a question where\\nthere are real and serious issues. Any question which is worth arguing\\nat all will have far more ground to cover, even when everything possible\\nhas been granted by both sides, than the average student can cover with\\nany thoroughness.\\n\\nNotebook. Enter those of the essential facts and definitions in\\nthe case which would be agreed to by both sides, and which are needed\\nfor an understanding of the brief.\\n\\nIllustration. Agreed Statement of Facts. For many years the tax\\nrate in Wytown has been high, and in the last ten years has not fallen\\nbelow twenty-four dollars on one thousand dollars. The city water supply\\nis of doubtful purity, and nothing has been done to improve it, chiefly\\nbecause the city debt is now close to the limit allowed by law. The\\npolice service has been inadequate, especially in the region known as\\nSouth Corner. Though two hundred thousand dollars have been spent on the\\nstreets in the last five years, the main street of the city is still\\nunpaved, and none of the other streets are macadamized. Though under the\\nlocal option law the city has uniformly voted for no license, yet there\\nis much liquor selling. The city officials have regularly been nominated\\nat Democratic and republican conventions.\\n\\nThe question has arisen at the present time because of quarrels between\\nthe mayor and aldermen, because of the petition of the city government\\nto the legislature to issue bonds for new waterworks above the\\nauthorized debt limit, because the tax rate last year was higher than\\never before in the history of the city, and because of the formation of\\na citizens\\' association which has been instrumental in securing from the\\nlegislature a bill authorizing the citizens to vote on the adoption of\\nthe proposed plan.\\n\\nPoints which are not discussed here will be taken up in succeeding\\npapers.\\n\\nThe definitions on page 70 are to be taken as part of this agreed\\nstatement.\\n\\n\\nEXERCISES\\n\\n1. Criticize the following sentences for their fitness as parts of\\nintroductions to briefs:\\n\\n    a. It is agreed that the commission form of government has succeeded\\n    in Des Moines because it is simple and easily controlled by the\\n    people.\\n\\n    b. Summer baseball is to be understood as playing baseball for\\n    money, for a man who is given his board and lodging by a hotel for\\n    playing is taking the equivalent of money.\\n\\n    c. (As one of the contentions for the affirmative on the question\\n    whether a street railroad should be compelled to build a certain new\\n    line, which would not be immediately profitable.) The convenience of\\n    the public should be considered before large dividends, since the\\n    public grants the franchise.\\n\\n2. Make an agreed statement of facts for an argument on one of the\\nsubjects in the list on pages 10-12.\\n\\nNOTE. This is a good exercise for class use: let the different members\\nof the class propose facts to be agreed on, and then put them before the\\nrest of the class for criticism.\\n\\n\\n23. Arrangement of Material. For the arrangement of the material in\\na brief, it is not possible to give much general advice, since this\\narrangement would change with the space allotted to the argument, and\\nespecially with the audience. On this point knowledge of your readers,\\nof their acquaintance with the subject, and of their prepossessions will\\ncount as much as knowledge of the subject when you come to the arguments\\nof practical life.\\n\\nIn general, if your audience is likely to be lukewarm or indifferent,\\nbegin with a point which will stir them up. In the argument on the\\nintroduction of commission government into Wytown, for which I have\\nconstructed a brief, I assumed that the citizens were already aroused to\\nthe need of some change, and therefore began by showing that the evils\\nof the present administration can be traced chiefly to the present\\nsystem of government. If I had assumed that the people needed first to\\nbe aroused to believing a change to be necessary, I should have put at\\nthe beginning an exposure of the corruption and inefficiency of the\\npresent city government, with specific cases to establish the point.\\n\\nLikewise for the close of your argument be sure that you have a strong\\nand effective point. In the case of commission government for Wytown, by\\nrefuting the objection that too much power is given to the councilmen I\\nprovide a chance to show at the same time how completely the commission\\ngovernment keeps the control in the hands of the people; and the latter\\npoint is the strongest that can be made for the commission form of\\ngovernment.\\n\\n24. The Place of the Refutation. The place of the refutation and\\nits extent also differ greatly with the audience. Sometimes it may\\noccupy practically the whole space. A few years ago _The Outlook_\\npublished an editorial opposing a change in the laws of New York\\nrelating to vivisection (for a part of it, see p. 44), in which it\\nrefuted the two arguments urged for the change, and then pointed out\\nthat the burden of proof still rested on the other side. Here the\\nrefutation occupied almost the whole of the argument. Huxley, in his\\nthree \"Lectures on Evolution,\" of which the first is printed on page\\n233, gave the whole of this first lecture to a refutation of the\\nalternative theories of the origin of plants and animals; since it was\\nnecessary to dispose of accepted theories before the new theory could\\nget a hearing, he put his refutation first.\\n\\nWhere there are no such special reasons, it is safe to follow the\\nprinciple that you should not draw more attention than necessary to the\\narguments on the other side. Refutation of less important statements and\\ncontentions will naturally come at the point of the argument which deals\\nwith that part of the subject. State them fairly always, but do not\\nmagnify their importance by dealing with them at too great length.\\n\\nIt is not often wise to lump the refutation at the end of your argument.\\nThe last impression on your audience is the strongest: it is good\\nstrategy to keep it for your own best points. Sometimes, as in the brief\\nworked out on page 90, it is possible to combine the refutation with\\npositive argument which will be effective; but do not forget that\\nnegative argument makes much less impression than that which is positive\\nand constructive.\\n\\n25. The Brief Proper. We have seen on page 47 that the brief is in\\nessence a statement of the logical framework of your argument. Its\\npurpose is to lay out your reasoning in such a way that you can\\nscrutinize each link and make sure that each assertion and each group of\\nassertions is attached to a firm support. For this reason the brief for\\na written or spoken argument is best thrown into the form of tabulated\\nstatements marked with a series of numbers and letters which will show\\nat a glance the exact place of each statement or assertion in the whole\\nsystem of reasoning. When you can thus, as it were, strip your argument\\nto its bones and tendons, you can go ahead with the confidence that your\\nreasoning is logically coherent.\\n\\nWhen you get out into the world you will work out your own way of making\\nbriefs for any arguments that fate imposes on you. The value of practice\\nnow is in being able to get at the work then without wasting time. The\\nrules below are offered to you as the result of long experiment and\\nstudy lay the best authorities. Moreover, if you are working in a class\\nyou should remember that you will get a great deal more out of your\\nteacher if you save his time by sticking closely to uniformity in\\noutward form.\\n\\nI shall first show how a brief is constructed, by following through part\\nof the process for the argument on the introduction of commission into\\nWytown; then I shall give the rules, with some explanation of their\\nworking and of their practical expediency.\\n\\nWe have just seen that the brief is essentially a display of the logical\\nframework of the argument: it should consist, therefore, of the main\\ncontentions in support of the proposition, with the reasons urged in\\nsupport of these contentions, and of the facts and reasons brought\\nforward in support of these reasons, this successive support of reasons\\nbeing carried down to ultimate facts, wherever possible.\\n\\nWhen you come to the working out of your brief you start with your main\\nissues, stated now as assertions. Then for each of them you give one or\\nmore reasons.\\n\\nIn the brief for introducing commission government into Wytown, let us\\nstart with the main issues for the affirmative, transforming them from\\nquestions into assertions. The first main issue would then read:\\n\\nThe admitted inefficiency of the city government at present is\\ndue to the system of government.\\n\\nThe next step is to assign reasons for making this assertion.\\nAccordingly we should add a \"since\" or a \"for\" to the assertion, and\\nthen underneath arrange these reasons in order. Let us suppose that we\\nput down three reasons:\\n\\nI. The admitted inefficiency of the city government at present\\nis due to the system of government; for\\n\\n    A. Partisan politics determine nominations to office;\\n\\n    B. Advantageous contracts cannot be made;\\n\\n    C. The responsibility for expenditures is scattered.\\n\\nEach of these assertions clearly needs to be supported before it will be\\naccepted. Let us follow out the support of the first one, and set down\\nhere the reasons and facts which will make it incontestable.\\n\\n    A. Partisan politics determine nominations to office; for\\n\\n         1. The organization of the national parties is permanent.\\n\\n         2. There has been bargaining between parties to reward\\n         political services with city offices.\\n\\nOf these points the first is an obvious fact; in the argument it will\\nneed only slight development and specification to make its bearing on\\nthe case effective. The second, on the other hand, must be supported by\\nevidence; and in the brief, accordingly, we should refer to the facts\\nas stated in newspapers of specified dates from which full quotation\\nwould be made in the argument. Here then, in both cases, though in\\ndifferent ways, we get down to the bed rock of fact on which the\\nreasoning is built up. At the same time, each joint in the framework of\\nthe reasoning has been laid bare, so that no weak place can escape\\ndetection. These are always the two main objects of making a brief--to\\nget down to the facts on which the reasoning is built up, and to display\\nevery essential step in the reasoning.\\n\\n26. Rules for Briefing. The rules given below are divided into two\\ngroups: those in the first group deal chiefly with the form of the\\nbrief; those in the second go more to the substance; but the distinction\\nbetween the two groups is far from being absolute.\\n\\n\\n\\n                         I\\n\\n1. A brief may be divided into three parts: the Introduction, the\\nProof, the Conclusion. Of these the Introduction should contain\\nnoncontentious matter, and the Conclusion should be a restatement of the\\nproposition, with a bare summary of the main issues in affirmative (or\\nnegative) form.\\n\\nThe introduction has already been dealt with at length (see pp. 48-81).\\nThe conclusion brings the main points of the argument together, and\\ngives an effect of workmanlike completeness to the brief. It should\\nnever introduce new points.\\n\\n2. In the Introduction keep each step of the analysis by itself, and\\nindicate the several parts by such headings as \"The following terms need\\ndefinition,\" \"The following facts are agreed on,\" \"The following points\\nwill be left out of consideration in this argument\" \"The chief\\ncontentions on the two sides are as follows,\" \"The main issues on which\\nthe argument will be made are as follows.\"\\n\\nIt is not to be expected that all these steps, with the appropriate\\nheadings, will be necessary in every brief. The only use of a brief is\\nto aid you to construct a specific argument, and you must consider each\\ncase by itself.\\n\\n3. Follow a uniform system of numbering throughout, so that each number\\nor letter used will show whether the statement is one of the main\\nsupports of your case, or in what degree it is subordinated.\\n\\nIn other words, the numbering should show at a glance whether a given\\nassertion is a main reason, a reason for a reason, or in still more\\nsubordinate degree of support. The system of numbering in the brief on\\npage 90 is convenient. Whatever system is adopted, it should be followed\\nby the whole class.\\n\\n4. The refutation should have a distinct set of symbols.\\n\\nThese symbols may well be uniform with the others, but with the prime\\nmark to distinguish them (see p. 93).\\n\\n5. In briefing the refutation always state first the assertion that is\\nto be refuted, with such connectives as, \"Although it is urged ..., yet\\nthe contention is unsound, for ...,\" \"Although the case is cited, ...\\nyet the case is irrelevant, for ...\"\\n\\nThese connectives will vary with the nature of the assertion to be\\nrefuted; the important thing is to state the assertion so clearly that\\nyour critic can judge the relevancy and force of your refutation. (For\\nexamples, see pp. 91-93.)\\n\\n                         II\\n\\n6. A brief in all its parts should be phrased in complete sentences;\\nmere topics are of no value.\\n\\nIn the brief on page 90, if the headings under I were \"A. Party\\npolitics, B. Waste in contracts, C. No responsibility for\\nexpenditures,\" neither the maker of the brief nor the critic of it could\\nknow with any certainty the course of the reasoning. It is undoubtedly\\ntrue that many lawyers and other men of affairs use only topic heads\\nwhen they are planning an argument; but it is to be remembered that they\\nare men who have been training their powers of thought in hard earnest,\\nand their ability to work out and stick to a train of reasoning with so\\nlittle written aid has not much bearing on what is the best practice for\\nyoung men who are in the process of gaining this ability. To make a full\\noutline of the reasoning in a few arguments is the best way to get the\\nsense for logical and coherent structure.\\n\\n7. Each heading should contain a single assertion only.\\n\\nThe reason for this rule is obvious: if under each assertion you are\\ngoing to set the reasons for that assertion, you will get into trouble\\nif your assertion is double-headed, since what is a reason for one part\\nof it may not be a reason for another. If in the brief on page 90\\nheading I B should read, \"Advantageous contracts cannot be made, and\\nthe responsibility for expenditures is scattered,\" subheading I C 2,\\n\"Accounts are submitted to separate committees of the two boards in\\nwhich no members have special responsibility,\" would have nothing to do\\nwith the making of contracts, and subheading I B 1, \"Contracts must be\\npassed on by both aldermen and common councilmen and the mayor,\" would\\nhave nothing to do with expenditures.\\n\\n8. In the body of the brief the assertions should be arranged as\\nfollows: Each main heading should embody one of the main issues as\\nstated in the Introduction; and each of the subordinate assertions\\nshould stand as a reason for the assertion to which it is subordinate.\\nThe connective between an assertion and one subordinate to it will\\ntherefore be for, since, or because, or the like, not hence or\\ntherefore, or the like.\\n\\nA brief thus arranged lays out the reasoning in a complete and easily\\nscrutinized form. Thus in the brief on page 90 for the assertion in the\\nfirst main issue, \"The admitted inefficiency, of the city government at\\npresent is due to the system of government,\" three chief reasons are\\ngiven: A. \"Partisan politics determine nominations to office,\" B.\\n\"Advantageous contracts cannot be made,\" and C. \"The responsibility for\\nexpenditures is scattered.\" Then for each of these secondary assertions\\nreasons in support are adduced; thus for B. \"Advantageous contracts\\ncannot be made,\" the reasons are I. \"Contracts must be passed on\\nseparately by aldermen, common councilmen, and the mayor,\" and 2.\\n\"Bargains are made between the aldermen representing different wards.\"\\nIn this case final references are given for each of these subordinate\\nassertions, so that we get down to the ultimate foundation of verifiable\\nfact on which the argument is to be built up.\\n\\nThe advantage of this form is that if you have set down several\\nassertions as reasons for another, and you are doubtful whether they all\\nbelong there, you can test them separately by putting them one by one\\nafter the main assertion they are intended to support with a \"for\" or a\\n\"since\" between.\\n\\nYou put the assertion first and the reason for it afterwards, because\\nwhen there is more than one reason in support, if you have the reason\\nfirst you must then repeat the assertion with each reason, or run the\\nrisk of confusion. If under I in the brief on page go, for example, you\\nbegan with the reason, \"In the present system partisan politics\\ndetermine nominations to office,\" and then added the result, \"Therefore\\nthe city government is inefficient,\" you would have to repeat the result\\nwith B and C; and when you came to the third degree of support, the\\nrepetition would be intolerably clumsy and confusing.\\n\\n9. Headings and subheadings should not have more than one numbering.\\n\\nThe reason for this rule is also obvious: each heading or subheading\\nmarks a step in the argument, and what belongs on one step cannot be on\\nanother at the same time. In the brief on page 90 the assertion that\\n\"Partisan politics determine nominations to office\" is stated as a chief\\nreason for the assertion in the first main issue, that \"The admitted\\ninefficiency of the city government at present is due to the system of\\ngovernment.\" It would confuse a reader to mark it A I, as if it wore a\\nsupport also in the second degree.\\n\\n10. The brief should give references to the evidence or authorities\\nrelied on to support assertions.\\n\\nGeneral references to articles and books which will be constantly\\nreferred to should be put at the beginning of the brief. References to\\nspecific statements of fact or quotations of opinion should be added as\\nthey occur in the brief (see the brief on p. 90).\\n\\n\\nEXERCISES\\n\\n1.

Evidence and Reasoning. We have seen in the last chapter that\\nthe chief value of making a brief is that in the first place it lays out\\nyour reasoning so that you can scrutinize it in detail; and that in the\\nsecond place it displays the foundations of your reasoning on facts\\nwhich cannot be contested. In this chapter we shall consider what\\ngrounds give validity to evidence and to reasoning.\\n\\nWhere the facts which you bring forward come from persons with\\nfirst-hand knowledge of them, they are direct evidence; where you must\\nestablish them by reasoning from other facts they are indirect evidence,\\nand in the latter case reasoning is an essential part of establishing\\nthe facts. In this chapter, therefore, I shall speak first of direct\\nevidence, then of indirect, and then pass on to consider a few of the\\nsimpler principles which govern reasoning.\\n\\nIn ordinary usage the word \"evidence\" is pretty vague, and means\\nanything that will help to establish one side or another of any\\nquestion, whether of fact or of policy. The word, however, comes\\nultimately from the law, where it is used for the testimony, either oral\\nor written or material, which is brought in to establish the truth of\\nassertions about fact: evidence is set before the jury, which under the\\ncommon law decides questions of fact. In almost any argument of policy,\\nhowever, we use facts as reasons for or against the policy which is in\\nquestion, and therefore inmost cases we must use evidence to establish\\nthese facts; in many cases, when the facts are established there is no\\nfurther disagreement about the policy. For example, in arguments for and\\nagainst state prohibition of the liquor trade, it is an essential fact\\nto determine whether in status where prohibition has been tried it has\\nfailed or succeeded, and another essential fact whether under similar\\nconditions a combination of high license and local option has or has not\\nproduced less drunkenness. Both are extremely complicated and difficult\\nfacts to decide; but if clear evidence can be brought forward to\\nestablish them, reasonable-minded people would generally hold as settled\\nthe question of the policy which should be adopted. Similarly, an\\nargument for the popular election of senators would undoubtedly make\\nlarge use of the alleged fact that, in elections by the legislatures,\\nthere has been much undue interference by special interests and rich\\ncorporations; and the assertion of this fact would have to be supported\\nby evidence. If this fact were thus clearly established, it would be\\nrecognized as a strong reason for a change in our present policy. In the\\ninterest of clearness of thought it is worth while to remember this\\ndistinction; for, as we shall see, it is only by so doing that we can\\ndetermine when the ordinary rules of logic do and when they do not apply\\nto the processes of reasoning on which argument is based. I shall speak\\nhere, therefore, of the evidence for facts, and of the reasons for or\\nagainst a policy.\\n\\nIt may be said in passing that the highly complicated rules of evidence\\nat the common law have practically nothing to do with our present\\nsubject, for they spring from very special conditions, and have been\\nmolded by very special purposes. Their object is to establish, so far as\\nis possible, principles which will apply to all cases of a like nature;\\nand they therefore rule out many facts and much evidence which outside\\nthe court we all use without hesitation in making up our minds. The jury\\nsystem has had a curious and interesting history: and judges have built\\nup hedges around juries which seem to the layman merely technical, and\\nunnecessary for the ends of justice.[14] Yet though the sweeping away of\\nmany of these rules from time to time shows that there has been and\\nperhaps still is justice in this view, one must remember that the whole\\ncommon law is based on the application of principles already established\\nby earlier cases to new cases of like character; and that great care\\nmust therefore be used not to establish principles which may interfere\\nwith the even distribution of justice in the long run (see on this point\\nS.R. Gardiner, p. 103). Even if in single cases the rule of evidence\\nthat forbids hearsay evidence works an injustice, yet in the long run it\\nis obvious both that, if hearsay were allowed, litigants would take less\\ntrouble to get original evidence, and that much hearsay is thoroughly\\nuntrustworthy.\\n\\nAnother reason why the rules of evidence at the common law have little\\nbearing on the arguments of everyday life is like that which makes it\\nunwise to dwell much on the burden of proof: there is no one either\\ncompetent or interested to enforce the exclusion. Assertion and rumor\\nmust be more than palpably vague before the ordinary man will of his own\\ninitiative take the trouble to scrutinize it; and even in refuting such\\nmaterial you must make its untrustworthiness very patent if you expect\\nto make ordinary readers distrust it seriously.\\n\\n28. Direct and Indirect Evidence. When we come now to consider how we\\nestablish facts, whether single or complex, we find that, both to aid\\nour own judgment and to convince other people, we rely on evidence. We\\nhave seen that evidence falls roughly into two classes: either it comes\\nfrom persons who testify out of their own observation and experience, or\\nit comes indirectly through reasoning from facts and principles already\\nestablished or granted. The two kinds of evidence run into each other,\\nand the terms commonly used to describe them vary: \"direct evidence\" is\\nnot infrequently, as in Huxley\\'s argument (see p. 240), called\\n\"testimonial,\" and \"indirect evidence,\" as in the same argument and in\\nthe opinion of Chief Justice Shaw, quoted below, is called\\n\"circumstantial.\" On the whole, however, the opposition between the two\\nclasses, so far as it is of practical importance, may best be indicated\\nby the terms \"direct evidence\" and \"indirect evidence.\" The distinction\\nbetween the two classes is made clear in the following extract from the\\nopinion of Chief Justice Shaw of the Massachusetts Supreme Court. It\\nwill be noticed that it is the same doctrine as that laid down by Huxley\\n(see p. 240).\\n\\nThe distinction, then, between direct and circumstantial evidence is\\nthis. Direct or positive evidence is when a witness can be called to\\ntestify to the precise; fact which is the subject of the issue in trial;\\nthat is, in a case of homicide, that the party accused did cause the\\ndeath of the deceased. Whatever may be the kind or force of the\\nevidence, this is the fact to be proved. But suppose no person was\\npresent on the occasion of the death,--and of course no one can be\\ncalled to testify to it,--is it wholly unsusceptible of legal proof?\\nExperience has shown that circumstantial evidence may be offered in such\\na case; that is, that a body of facts may be proved of so conclusive a\\ncharacter, as to warrant a firm belief of the fact, quite as strong and\\ncertain as that on which discreet men are accustomed to act in relation\\nto their most important concerns....\\n\\nEach of these modes of proof has its advantages and disadvantages; it is\\nnot easy to compare their relative value. The advantage of positive\\nevidence is, that you have the direct testimony of a witness to the fact\\nto be proved, who, if he speaks the truth, saw it done; and the only\\nquestion is, whether he is entitled to belief. The disadvantage is, that\\nthe witness may be false and corrupt, and the case may not afford the\\nmeans of detecting his falsehood.\\n\\nBut in a case of circumstantial evidence where no witness can testify\\ndirectly to the fact to be proved, you arrive at it by a series of other\\nfacts, which by experience we have found so associated with the fact in\\nquestion, as in the relation of cause and effect, that they lead to a\\nsatisfactory and certain conclusion; as when footprints are discovered\\nafter a recent snow, it is certain that some animated being has passed\\nover the snow since it fell; and, from the form and number of the\\nfootprints, it can be determined with equal certainty, whether it was a\\nman, a bird, or a quadruped. Circumstantial evidence, therefore, is\\nfounded on experience and observed facts and coincidences, establishing\\na connection between the known and proved facts and the fact sought to\\nbe proved.[15]\\n\\nUnder the head of direct evidence, as I shall use the term, would fall\\nthe evidence of material objects: in an accident case, for example, the\\nscar of a wound may be shown to the jury; or where the making of a park\\nis urged on a city government, the city council may be taken out to see\\nthe land which it is proposed to take. Though such evidence is not\\ntestimony, it is direct evidence, for it is not based on reasoning and\\ninference.\\n\\n29. Direct Evidence. Direct evidence is the testimony of persons\\nwho know about the fact from their own observation: such is the\\ntestimony of the witnesses to a will that they saw the testator sign it,\\nthe testimony of an explorer that there are tribes of pygmies in Africa,\\nthe testimony of a chemist to the constituents of a given alloy, or of a\\ndoctor to the success of a new treatment. Every day of our lives we are\\ngiving and receiving direct evidence; and of this evidence there is\\ngreat variety in value.\\n\\nIn the first place, no one should place too much reliance on his own\\ncasual observations. It is notorious that we see what we expect to see;\\nand no one who has not deliberately set himself to observe the fact can\\nrealize how much of what he thinks is observation is really inference\\nfrom a small part of the facts before him. I feel a slight tremor run\\nthrough the house with a little rattling of the windows, and assume that\\na train has gone by on the railroad below the hill a hundred yards away:\\nas a matter of fact it may have been one of the slight earthquake shocks\\nwhich come every few years in most parts of the world. The mistakes that\\nmost of its make in recognizing people are of the same sort: from some\\nsingle feature we reason to an identity that does not exist.\\n\\nOf recent years psychologists have set themselves to getting some\\naccurate facts as to this inaccuracy of human observation, and various\\nexperiments have been tried. Here is an account of one:\\n\\nThere was, for instance, two years ago in Goettingen a meeting of a\\nscientific association, made up of jurists, psychologists, and\\nphysicians, all, therefore, men trained in careful observation.\\nSomewhere in the same street there was that evening a public festivity\\nof the carnival. Suddenly, in the midst of the scholarly meeting, the\\ndoors open, a clown in highly  costume rushes in in mad\\nexcitement, and a <DW64> with a revolver in hand follows him. In the\\nmiddle of the hall first the one, then the other, shouts wild phrases;\\nthen the one falls to the ground, the other jumps on him; then a shot,\\nand suddenly both are out of the room. The whole affair took less than\\ntwenty seconds. All were completely taken by surprise, and no one, with\\nthe exception of the president, had the slightest idea that every word\\nand action had been rehearsed beforehand, or that, photographs had been\\ntaken of the scene. It seemed most natural that the president should beg\\nthe members to write down individually an exact report, inasmuch as he\\nfelt sure that the matter would come before the courts. Of the forty\\nreports handed in, there was only one whose omissions were calculated as\\namounting to less than twenty per cent of the characteristic acts;\\nfourteen had twenty to forty per cent of the facts omitted; twelve\\nomitted forty to fifty per cent, and thirteen still more than fifty per\\ncent. But besides the omissions there were only six among the forty\\nwhich did not contain positively wrong statements; in twenty-four\\npapers up to ten per cent of the statements were free inventions, and in\\nten answers--that is, in one fourth of the papers--more than ten per\\ncent of the statements were absolutely false, in spite of the fact that\\nthey all came from scientifically trained observers. Only four persons,\\nfor instance, among forty noticed that the <DW64> had nothing on his\\nhead; the others gave him a derby, or a high hat, and so on. In addition\\nto this, a red suit, a brown one, a striped one, a coffee-\\njacket, shirt sleeves, and similar costume were invented for him. He\\nwore in reality white trousers and a black jacket with a large red\\nneck-tie. The scientific commission which reported the details of the\\ninquiry came to the general statement that the majority of the observers\\nomitted or falsified about half of the processes which occurred\\ncompletely in their field of vision. As was to be expected, the judgment\\nas to the time duration of the act varied between a few seconds and\\nseveral minutes.[16]\\n\\nAnother type of cases in which our direct testimony would be valueless\\nis legerdemain: we think that we actually see rabbits taken out of our\\nneighbor\\'s hat, or his watch pounded in a mortar and presently shaken\\nwhole and sound out of an empty silk handkerchief; and it is only by\\nreasoning that we know our eyes have been deceived.\\n\\nIt is obvious, therefore, that to question a man\\'s evidence is not\\nalways to call him a liar; in most cases it is rather to question the\\naccuracy of his inferences from such part of the facts as he actually\\ngrasped. In science no important observation is accepted until the\\nexperiments have been repeated and checked by other observers. Indeed,\\nmost of the progress of science is due to the repetition of experiments\\nby observers who notice some critical phenomena which their predecessors\\nhave missed.\\n\\nWith this qualification, that human observation is always fallible,\\ngood direct evidence is on the whole the most convincing evidence that\\nyou can use. If you can establish a fact by the mouths of trustworthy\\nwitnesses, making your readers recognize that these witnesses had good\\nopportunities of observation and a competent knowledge of the subject,\\nyou will generally establish your point. In case of an accident in a\\nstreet car it is the custom of many companies to require their\\nconductors to take down immediately the names of a few of the most\\nrespectable-looking of the passengers, who may be called as witnesses in\\ncase of a lawsuit. All the observations of science, and most of the\\nfacts brought before juries in courts of law, as well as the multitude\\nof lesser and greater facts which we accept in everyday life, get their\\nauthority from this principle.\\n\\nIn the arguments of school and college you may not make much use of\\ndirect evidence, for they do not often turn on single, simple facts.\\nEven here, however, cases arise where you must call in the direct\\ntestimony of witnesses. If you were arguing that secret societies should\\nbe abolished in a certain school, and wished to show that such societies\\nhad led to late hours, playing cards for money, and drinking, you would\\nneed direct evidence. If you were arguing that the street railroad\\ncompany of your city should be obliged to double track a certain part of\\nits line, you would need direct evidence of the delays and crowding of\\ncars with a single track.\\n\\nWhen you are using direct evidence you should make it clear that the\\nperson from whom it comes is a competent witness, that he has been in a\\nposition to know the facts at first hand, and that, if necessary, he has\\nhad the proper training to understand their meaning. In the case of an\\nautomobile accident a man who had never run a car would not be the best\\nsort of witness as to the actions of the chauffeur, nor a man who had\\nnever sailed a boat as to what happened in a collision between two\\nsailboats. In a scientific matter the observations of a beginner would\\nnot carry weight as against those of a man who had used a microscope for\\nmany years.\\n\\nThe witness, too, must be shown to be free from bias, whether practical\\nor theoretical. It is a well-known fact that men differ greatly in the\\nclearness of their eyesight in observing the stars, and that men who are\\ngifted with exceptional eyesight may make valuable discoveries with\\ninferior instruments; but if such a man has espoused a theory, say, as\\nto the nature of the rings of Saturn, and is known to defend it\\npassionately, his evidence concerning what he had seen is bound to be\\nsomewhat discounted.\\n\\nEven official reports cannot be trusted without scrutiny.\\n\\nThe fact is that many things conspire to make an official report\\nconstrained and formal. There is the natural desire of every man to put\\nthe best face on things for himself as he sets his case before the\\ngovernment and the world; subordinates must be let off leniently; you\\nmust live with them, and it impairs comfort to have them sullen. To make\\na statement unpleasant to a superior might be construed as\\ninsubordination. The public welfare makes it imperative to tell a\\nflattering tale. The temptation is constant to tell not quite the whole\\ntruth, and nothing but the truth. There are important suppressions of\\nfact in the official records, none more so, perhaps, than as regards\\nChancellorsville.[17]\\n\\nIf you happen to be dealing with a historical matter, where the\\ntestimony comes from a more or less remote past, and the evidence is\\nscrappy and defective, you must be still more careful.\\n\\nThe great English historian, the late S.R. Gardiner, in his\\nexamination of the evidence on the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, wrote as\\nfollows about the difficulties of dealing with historical evidence:\\n\\nIt seems strange to find a writer so regardless of what is, in these\\ndays, considered the first canon of historical inquiry, that evidence\\nworth having must be almost entirely the evidence of contemporaries who\\nare in a position to know something about that which they assert. It is\\ntrue that this canon must not be received pedantically. Tradition is\\nworth something, at all events when it is not too far removed from its\\nsource. If a man whose character for truthfulness stands high, tells me\\nthat his father, also believed to be truthful, seriously informed him\\nthat he had seen a certain thing happen, I should be much more likely to\\nbelieve that it was so than if a person, whom I knew to be untruthful,\\ninformed me that he had himself witnessed something at the present day.\\nThe historian is not bound, as the lawyer is, to reject hearsay\\nevidence, because it is his business to ascertain the truth of\\nindividual assertions, whilst the lawyer has to think of the bearing of\\nthe evidence not merely on the case of the prisoner in the dock, but on\\nan unrestricted number of possible prisoners, many of whom would be\\nunjustly condemned if hearsay evidence were admitted. The historian is,\\nhowever, bound to remember that evidence grows weaker with each link of\\nthe chain. The injunction, \"Always leave a story better than you found\\nit,\" is in accordance with the facts of human nature. Each reporter\\ninevitably accentuates the side of the narrative which strikes his\\nfancy, and drops some other part which interests him less. The rule laid\\ndown by the late Mr. Spedding, \"When a thing is asserted as a fact,\\nalways ask who first reported it, and what means he had of knowing the\\ntruth,\" is an admirable corrective of loose traditional stories.\\n\\nA further test has to be applied by each investigator for himself. When\\nwe have ascertained, as far as possible, on what evidence our knowledge\\nof an alleged fact rests, we have to consider the inherent probability\\nof the allegation. Is the statement about it in accordance with the\\ngeneral workings of human nature, or with the particular working of the\\nnature of the persons to whom the action in question is ascribed? Father\\nGerard,[18] for instance, lavishly employs this test. Again and again he\\ntells us that such and such a statement is incredible, because, amongst\\nother reasons, the people about whom it was made could not possibly have\\nacted in the way ascribed to them. If I say in any of these cases that\\nit appears to me probable that they did so act, it is merely one\\nindividual opinion against another. There is no mathematical certainty\\non either side. All we can respectively do is to set forth the reasons\\nwhich incline us to one opinion or another, and leave the matter to\\nothers to judge as they see fit.\\n\\nIt will be necessary hereafter to deal at length with father Gerard\\'s\\nattack upon the evidence, hitherto accepted as conclusive, of the facts\\nof the plot. A short space may be allotted to the reasons for rejecting\\nhis preliminary argument, that it was the opinion of some\\ncontemporaries, and of some who lived in a later generation, that\\nSalisbury contrived the plot in part, if not altogether. Does he realize\\nhow difficult it is to prove such a thing by any external evidence\\nwhatever? If hearsay evidence can be taken as an argument of\\nprobability, and in some cases of strong probability, it is where some\\none material fact is concerned. For instance, I am of opinion that it is\\nvery likely that the story of Cromwell\\'s visit to the body of Charles I\\non the night after the king\\'s execution is true, though the evidence is\\nonly that Spence heard it from Pope, and Pope heard it, mediately or\\nimmediately, from Southampton, who, it is alleged, saw the scene with\\nhis own eyes. It is very different when we are concerned with evidence\\nas to an intention necessarily kept secret, and only exhibited by overt\\nacts in such form as tampering with documents, suggesting false\\nexplanation of evidence, and so forth. A rumor that Salisbury got up the\\nplot is absolutely worthless; a rumor that he forged a particular\\ninstrument would be worth examining, because it might have proceeded\\nfrom some one who had seen him do it.[19]\\n\\nWhile it is rare to find a man of whom it may justly be said that there\\nis no partition between his memory and his imagination, yet there are\\nfew of us who can be sure of facts in past matters which touch our\\nfeelings. We cannot help to some degree reconstructing events as they\\nfade away into the past: we forget those parts of an event which did not\\nat the time sharply touch our imagination, and those which did move us\\ntake on an overshadowing importance. Therefore the further away the\\nevents which the evidence is to reconstruct, the more care we must take\\nto scrutinize it to see if there are signs of bias.\\n\\nTo test the value of direct evidence, therefore, as to single and simple\\nfacts, consider whether the evidence comes from a specifically named\\nsource, whether there is any likelihood that the witness may have been\\nhonestly deceived in his observation, whether he had a good opportunity\\nto know the facts and a sufficient knowledge of the subject about which\\nhe is giving evidence, and, finally, whether he was reasonably free from\\nbias in the matter.\\n\\nWhenever you use direct evidence, however, it must be direct. To assert\\nthat \"every one knows that secret societies in a certain school have led\\nto immoral practices,\" is not direct evidence, nor to declare that \"the\\nbest authorities in the city are agreed that the company should lay\\ndouble tracks on a certain street.\" Such assertions are apt to be the\\nmost roundabout sort of hearsay. Try cross-examining the next man you\\nhear make this kind of sweeping assertion, in order to see what he\\nreally knows of the facts, and you will soon find how recklessly such\\nassertions are made. You constantly hear grave statements of facts whose\\nultimate basis is the imagination of some enterprising newspaper\\nreporter; yet careful and truthful people pass them on as if they were\\nindubitable.\\n\\nThe news columns of the papers are largely written by young fellows just\\nout of high school, who will declare the whole gospel on subjects with\\nwhich they have a half hour\\'s acquaintance, yet most people never\\nquestion their statements. The printed page, whether of a hook, a\\nmagazine, or a newspaper, casts a spell on our judgment. Such floating\\nassertions, with no one to father them, are of no value whatever. If you\\nhave to use statements in a newspaper as direct evidence, either take\\nthem from a newspaper which is recognized as careful about facts, or\\nelse look up the matter in two or three papers, and show that their\\ntestimony agrees.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a specific name, with a specific reference to volume\\nand page, will go a long way to give your readers confidence in the\\nevidence you adduce. And rightly so, for one man with a name and address\\nis worth hundreds of unnamed \"highest authorities\"; and the more\\nspecifically you refer to him and to his evidence, the more likely you\\nwill be to win over your audience to your view.\\n\\nA famous and effective example of the use of specific names to give\\nauthority to an argument, and the incidental refutation of a vague and\\nloose assertion, is found in Lincoln\\'s address at Cooper Institute, in\\nthe first part of which he took up Senator Douglas\\'s statement that \"our\\nfathers, when they framed the government under which we live, understood\\nthis question just as well as, and even better than, we do now,\" with\\nthe implication that they intended to forbid the federal government to\\ncontrol slavery in the federal territories. Lincoln showed that \"our\\nfathers who framed the government under which we live\" must be the\\nmakers of the Constitution: and then he proceeded to show just what\\naction each one of them, so far as record had been preserved, had taken\\non the question. Here is a passage from his argument:\\n\\nThe question of Federal control in the Territories seems not to have\\nbeen directly before the convention which framed the original\\nConstitution; and hence it is not recorded that the \"thirty-nine,\" or\\nany of them, while engaged on that instrument, expressed any opinion on\\nthat precise question.\\n\\nIn 1789, by the first Congress which sat under the Constitution, an act\\nwas passed to enforce the ordinance of 1787, including the prohibition\\nof slavery in the Northwestern Territory. The bill for this act was\\nreported by one of the \"thirty-nine\"--Thomas Fitzsimmons, then a member\\nof the House of Representatives from Pennsylvania. It went through all\\nits stages without a word of opposition, and finally passed both\\nbranches without ayes and nays, which is equivalent to a unanimous\\npassage. In this Congress there were sixteen of the thirty-nine fathers\\nwho framed the original Constitution. They were John Langdon, Nicholas\\nGilman, William S. Johnson, Roger Sherman, Robert Morris, Thomas\\nFitzsimmons, William Few, Abraham Baldwin, Rufus King, William Paterson,\\nGeorge Clymer, Richard Bassett, George Read, Pierce Butler, Daniel\\nCarroll, and James Madison.\\n\\nThis shows that, in their understanding, no line dividing local from\\nFederal authority, nor anything in the Constitution, properly forbade\\nCongress to prohibit slavery in the Federal territory; else both their\\nfidelity to correct principle, and their oath to support the\\nConstitution, would have constrained them to oppose the prohibition.\\n\\nAgain, George Washington, another of the \"thirty-nine,\" was then\\nPresident of the United States and as such approved and signed the bill,\\nthus completing its validity as a law, and thus showing that, in his\\nunderstanding, no line dividing local from Federal authority, nor\\nanything in the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control\\nas to slavery in Federal territory.\\n\\nNo great while after the adoption of the original Constitution, North\\nCarolina ceded to the Federal Government the country now constituting\\nthe State-of Tennessee; and a few years later Georgia ceded that which\\nnow constitutes the States of Mississippi and Alabama. In both deeds of\\ncession it was made a condition by the ceding States that the Federal\\nGovernment should not prohibit slavery in the ceded country. Besides\\nthis, slavery was then actually in the ceded country. Under these\\ncircumstances, Congress, on taking charge of these countries, did not\\nabsolutely prohibit slavery in them. But they did interfere with\\nit--take control of it----even there, to a certain extent. In 1798\\nCongress organized the Territory of Mississippi. In the act of\\norganization they prohibited the bringing of slaves into the Territory\\nfrom any place without the United States, by fine, and giving freedom to\\nslaves so brought. This act passed both branches of Congress without\\nyeas and nays. In that Congress were three of the \"thirty-nine\" who\\nframed the original Constitution. They were John Langdon, George Read,\\nand Abraham Baldwin. They all probably voted for it. Certainly they\\nwould have placed their opposition to it upon record if, in their\\nunderstanding, any line dividing local from Federal authority, or\\nanything in the Constitution, properly forbade the Federal Government to\\ncontrol as to slavery in Federal territory.\\n\\nIn the end this exact statement of names, for which he had prepared\\nhimself with such laborious care, enabled Lincoln to sum up with\\nabsolute conclusiveness:\\n\\nThe cases I have mentioned are the only acts of the \"thirty-nine,\" or of\\nany of them, upon the direct issue, which I have been able to discover.\\n\\nTo enumerate the persons who thus acted as being four in 1784, two in\\n1787, seventeen in 1789, three in 1798, two in 7804, and two in\\n1819-1820, there would be thirty of them. But this would be counting\\nJohn Langdon, Roger Sherman, William Few, Rufus King, and George Read\\neach twice, and Abraham Baldwin three times. The true number of those of\\nthe \"thirty-nine\" whom I have shown to have acted upon the question\\nwhich, by the text, they understood better than we, is twenty-three,\\nleaving sixteen not shown to have acted upon it in any way.\\n\\nHere, then, we have twenty-three out of our thirty-nine fathers \"who\\nframed the government under which we live,\" who have, upon their\\nofficial responsibility and their corporal oaths, acted upon the very\\nquestion which the text affirms they \"understood just as well, and even\\nbetter, than we do now\"; and twenty-one of them--a clear majority of the\\nwhole \"thirty-nine\"--so acting upon it as to make them guilty of gross\\npolitical impropriety and willful perjury if, in their understanding,\\nany proper division between local and Federal authority, or anything in\\nthe Constitution they had made themselves, and sworn to support, forbade\\nthe Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal\\nterritories. Thus the twenty-one acted; and, as actions speak louder\\nthan words, so actions under such responsibility speak still louder.\\n\\nWhen you come to evidence about a large and complex state of affairs,\\nwhich is the kind of fact that so many of the arguments of practical\\nlife deal with, though you will still be dealing with a fact, yet the\\nvery nature of the fact changes the value and the character of your\\nevidence. It is a comparatively simple matter to determine whether a\\ncertain woman faced forward or backward as she was getting off a street\\ncar, or whether the eggs of a sea urchin do or do not begin to germinate\\nunder the influence of a certain chemical substance; but it is far from\\nsimple to determine whether a free elective course has or has not inured\\nto greater intelligence and cultivation in the graduates of a certain\\ncollege, or whether the graduates of another college where the classical\\ncourse is maintained have keener and more flexible minds and more\\nrefined tastes as a result of their study of the classics. In such cases\\nas these the citing of direct evidence brings on you difficulties of a\\ndifferent kind from those you face when you are establishing a single,\\nsimple fact. Here you will usually depend on two main sources of\\nevidence: statistics, and the evidence of recognized authorities on the\\nsubject.\\n\\n30. Statistics. Statistics, which are collections of figures, are\\nnotoriously treacherous. On many important subjects, such, for example,\\nas the practical effect of the elective system, it is impossible to get\\nthem; and on many other subjects, such as the effects of a protective\\ntariff, they must be had in so enormous masses, if they are to be\\ntrusted at all, that only profound students can handle them. Where the\\nfacts are complicated, and interests are tangled, moreover, many sets of\\nfigures may enter into the question, as notably in the case of a tariff;\\nso clearly is this difficulty now recognized that Congress has\\nauthorized a tariff board made up of distinguished students of economics\\nand men of long experience in dealing with tariff matters to collect and\\nstudy the facts and make recommendations based on them. Similarly, with\\nthe investigation into the liquor question made fifteen years ago by the\\nCommittee of Fifty: the whole question had been so tangled by assertion\\nand counter-assertion that it became desirable to have an investigation\\ninto the facts by men of recognized ability and impartiality.[20]\\n\\nIn general, to use statistics safely you need a wide acquaintance with a\\nsubject, especially where the question is in any way mixed up with men\\'s\\nfeelings, whether through politics or not. All the statistics we have\\nmake dead against great armaments and preparation for war; yet while\\nhuman nature is what it is, necessary prudence seems to require every\\nnation of any size to have them. A very little human nature will upset a\\nvery great body of statistics. Furthermore, in most human affairs\\nresults are produced by a multiplicity of causes; and though statistics\\nmay throw light on three quarters of all the causes that are potent in\\nany given case, yet the other quarter which are irreducible to definite\\nstatement may wholly alter the result. If you are using statistics in\\nyour argument, therefore, as evidence of some large and complex fact,\\nyou should usually justify them to some extent by showing that there are\\nno counteracting forces which they do not cover.\\n\\nWith this precaution, however, statistics are the foundation of most\\narguments on large questions. If you were arguing in favor of the\\npurchase of local waterworks, you would present figures showing the\\nnumber of houses using the public water supply, the rates paid, the\\nprofits of the company, the exact points at which public control could\\nwork economies. If you were arguing for a rule that no man shall play on\\na university team until he has been registered a year at the university,\\nyou would need statistics to show how many men would be affected by the\\nrule. If you were arguing for a single session at a school instead of\\ntwo, you would show exactly how many students in the school live more\\nthan a mile away from the building. In every case where statistics can\\nbe presented in such a way as to make clear that they fairly cover the\\nground, they are most valuable evidence. They give the argument the\\neffect of being founded on a rock. If it be obvious that the statistics\\nhave been freshly gathered, and are not merely casual and second-hand\\ngleanings, they have still greater effect, for then they have a\\nsecondary force in testifying to the personal knowledge that the witness\\nhas of the subject. We shall see later the danger of the fallacy of\\ngeneralizing on too narrow a basis: a generalization based on a good\\nbody of statistics runs no danger of this fallacy.\\n\\n31. The Opinion of Recognized Authorities. The other chief source\\nof evidence to establish a fact which consists of a large and complex\\nstate of affairs is the opinion of recognized authorities on the\\nsubject. The strength of such evidence depends on whether the audience\\nwill accept the person you cite as having authority on the matter. Most\\nof us read some newspaper or periodical in the opinions of which we have\\nconfidence, because they seem to be based on investigation and competent\\nknowledge. The annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury is\\nexcellent evidence on the state of the national finances. The reports of\\npresidents of colleges are excellent evidence from authorities on such\\nquestions as the value of the elective system or the effect of raising\\nthe standard of admission. The report of a dean or of a schoolmaster on\\nthe value of organized athletics is effective if the audience knows that\\nhe likes out-of-door sports and takes time to see the games. Evidence\\ndrawn from an authority who is likely to be used by the other side is\\ndoubly effective, since your readers recognize that his competence is\\nadmitted.\\n\\nIf a man has given his life to the study of a subject and has published\\nbooks that are of recognized authority, his evidence will be of especial\\nweight. Mr. Bryce\\'s opinion on all questions concerning a state of\\naffairs in this country would be recognized at once as weighty, for he\\nhas given time and study to collecting the multitude of small facts\\nwhich constitute the large fact. His opinion that political honesty is\\nincreasing with us has brought comfort to many good citizens who had\\ngrown despondent over the accounts of recurrent rascality in the\\nnewspapers and magazines. This is a typical case for the citation of\\nauthorities; for the facts are enormous in number, very widely\\nscattered, and often contradictory. Only a man who has taken the pains\\nto keep himself constantly informed, whose judgment has been trained by\\nlong consideration and comparison of the facts, and who is born with the\\njudicial temperament can attain the authority of Mr. Bryce.\\n\\nThere will be cases on which you will have the right to put yourself\\nforward as an authority, for on many subjects which fall within the\\nrange of undergraduates their knowledge is first-hand. On all questions\\nof athletics, especially, an undergraduate is apt to have freshly in\\nmind a considerable mass of facts. In the same way, on the results of\\ncertain requirements for admission to college, you can speak from recent\\nexperience. In matters concerning your own city, too, you may have\\noriginal knowledge.\\n\\nIf you are going to put yourself forward as an authority, however, you\\nmust round out your knowledge of the facts by extending it beyond your\\nown personal experience. If it is a question of entrance requirements,\\nyou cannot stop with your own experience, or even with that of your own\\nclass at school. You must go back to the records of a number of classes\\nbefore and perhaps after your own, and talk them over with the principal\\nof the school, to see whether there are any special circumstances which\\naffect any of them. If you are arguing for or against a change in the\\npresent rules of football, you would have to go beyond the games of your\\nown college team, and beyond those of the present season. If, for\\nexample, it were a question of amending the rules concerning the forward\\npass, you could not speak with full authority unless you had looked up\\nthe accounts of the principal games for two or three years at any rate.\\nIf you put yourself forward, then, as a witness on one of these cases of\\ncomplicated facts, you must make it clear to your readers that you have\\na right to be considered such. If you have the right, it would be folly\\nto hide your light under a bushel.\\n\\nAn example of the care which is taken by men who have made themselves\\nauthorities on their subjects is to be found in the following passage\\nfrom President Eliot\\'s address, \"A Wider Range of Electives in College\\nAdmission Requirements.\"[21] Notice how broad a basis he lays for his\\nconclusions both in facts and in the opinions of other authorities.\\nWhat should be the grounds of a just valuation of all the subjects\\nthat can be presented at admission examinations which include\\nnumerous options?\\n\\nThat question introduces us to a difficult inquiry. It is, of course,\\nnot an intelligent method to attribute a value to each subject in\\naccordance with the time devoted to the examination in that subject.\\nWhat clue have we toward a better mode of determining the value\\nwhich ought to be attributed to each of the numerous electives,\\nwhen the young men cannot present all the permitted subjects,\\nand hardly three fifths of them, indeed, if the range is adequately\\nwidened? I believe that the best criterion for determining the value\\nof each subject is the time devoted to that subject in schools which\\nhave an intelligent program of studies. The Committee of Ten[22]\\nexamined the number of subjects used in about two hundred of the\\nbest secondary schools in this country, and the time-allotments for\\nthe several subjects. They found a great variety of practice as to\\nboth selection of subjects and time-allotments. You can hardly say\\nthat there is an accepted time-allotment in these secondary schools\\nfor any subject--not even for the old traditional subjects. The\\ntime-allotments differ widely in different parts of the country, and\\neven in different schools in the same part of the country. If, then,\\nwe are to determine by school time-allotments the valuations of the\\ndifferent subjects, prescribed and elective, which may enter into\\nadmission examinations, we must have some sort of standard programs for\\nsecondary schools. At present (1896) I know no programs which can answer\\nthat purpose, except the provisional programs of the Committee of Ten.\\nThey may fairly be said to be the best-studied programs now before the\\ncountry, and to represent the largest amount of professional consent,\\nsimply because they are the result of the work, first, of ninety school\\nand college teachers, divided into nine different conferences by\\nsubject, and secondly, of ten representative teachers combining and\\nrevising the work of the conferences, with careful reference to the\\npresent condition of American schools.\\n\\n32. Indirect Evidence. The term \"indirect evidence\" may be used for\\nall evidence as to fact in which reasoning consciously plays a part.\\nWithout it we should be helpless in large regions of our intellectual\\nlife, notably in science and history, and constantly in everyday life.\\nClearly the line between direct and indirect evidence is vague and\\nuncertain; it is one of the first things learned in psychology that our\\nperceptions and judgments of things about us are almost never based\\nexclusively on the testimony of our senses, and that we are all the time\\njumping to conclusions from very partial observations.\\n\\nProfessor Muensterberg gives the following example from his own\\nexperience of this unintentional substitution of indirect evidence for\\ndirect:\\n\\nLast summer I had to face a jury as witness in a trial. While I was with\\nmy family at the seashore my city house had been burglarized and I was\\ncalled upon to give an account of my findings against the culprit whom\\nthey caught with part of the booty. I reported under oath that the\\nburglars had entered through a cellar window, and then described what\\nrooms they had visited. To prove, in answer to a direct question, that\\nthey had been there at night, I told that I had found drops of candle\\nwax on the second floor. To show that they intended, to return, I\\nreported that they had left a large mantel clock, packed in wrapping\\npaper, on the dining-room table. Finally, as to the amount of clothes\\nwhich they had taken, I asserted that the burglars did not get more than\\na specified list which I had given the police.\\n\\nOnly a few days later I found that every one of these statements was\\nwrong. They had not entered through the window, but had broken the lock\\nof the cellar door; the clock was not packed by them in wrapping paper,\\nbut in a tablecloth; the candle droppings were not on the second floor,\\nbut in the attic; the list of lost garments was to be increased by seven\\nmore pieces; and while my story under oath spoke always of two burglars,\\nI do not know that there was more than one.[23]\\n\\nConstantly in everyday life we make offhand assertions in the full\\nbelief that we are giving direct evidence, when as a matter of fact we\\nare announcing inferences. The distinction is of importance in many\\nways, and not least as a means of avoiding heat in argument; for to\\nquestion a man\\'s inference is much less likely to make him angry than to\\ndeny his statement of fact.\\n\\nFor the practical purposes of argument we may let the distinction\\nbetween observation and inference, and consequently that between direct\\nand indirect evidence, turn on whether the inference is a conscious and\\nreadily distinguishable part of the judgment or not. Though bringing to\\nlight an unconscious inference is often an essential part of the\\ndetection of false reasoning, where there is no such practical\\nconsequence, we need not be too curious here about the line between\\ndirect observation and inference from observation. For the rough and\\nready purposes of everyday arguments it is exact enough to say that\\nwhere you recognize that you are basing your conclusion as to a fact on\\nsome process of reasoning, then you are resting on indirect evidence;\\nwhere you do not recognize the inference without reflection, you are\\nresting on direct evidence.\\n\\nIn the following discussion of reasoning I shall sometimes be dealing\\nwith proving a fact, sometimes with arguing forward to a policy. In many\\ncases the two processes are practically identical, for if the fact is\\nestablished the policy follows as a matter of course: in these cases,\\ntherefore, for the sake of convenience I shall use the terms\\ninterchangeably, and keep them separate only where there is danger of\\nconfusion.\\n\\n33. Reasoning. Though the various forms of reasoning and the\\nprinciples which they follow are the concern rather of psychology and\\nlogic than of a practical work on the writing of arguments, yet these\\nsciences help us to understand the processes of the mind by which we\\nconvince first ourselves, and then other people, of the existence of\\nfacts, when for one reason or another direct testimony is wanting.\\nPsychology describes the processes of reasoning as part of the activity\\nof the mind, analyzes them into their parts, and shows their working.\\nLogic is concerned rather with the forms of reasoning: its aim is to\\nestablish principles and rules the application of which will insure\\ncorrect reasoning.\\n\\nI shall first briefly and very simply sketch the underlying nature of\\nthe reasoning process as it is described by psychologists; then I shall\\npass on to a practical application of the principles thereby attained;\\nnext I shall set forth a few of the simplest and clearest of the\\nprocesses of reasoning which have been worked out by logic; and,\\nfinally, I shall discuss each few of the best-recognized forms of false\\nreasoning. From both the psychological description and the rules of\\nlogic we shall derive practical suggestions for establishing facts\\nwhich may be needed in an argument.\\n\\nThe essential feature of the process of reasoning is that it proceeds\\nfrom like to like, by breaking up whole facts and phenomena,\\nand following out the implications or consequences of one\\nor more of the parts.[24] For example, if I infer, when my dog\\ncomes out of a barnyard with an apologetic air, and with blood and\\nfeathers on his mouth, that he has been killing a hen, I am breaking\\nup the whole phenomenon of the dog\\'s appearance, and paying\\nattention only to the blood and feathers on his head; and\\nthese lead me directly to similar appearances when I have caught\\nhim in the act. If I reason, Every student who can concentrate his\\nattention can learn quickly, George Marston has a notable power\\nof concentration, Therefore George Marston can learn quickly, I\\nagain break up the abstraction _student_, and the concrete fact\\n_George Marston_, and pay attention in each to the single characteristic,\\n_concentration of attention_. Thus by means of these similar\\nparts of different wholes I pass from the assertion concerning the\\nclass as a whole to the assertion concerning the concrete case.\\nThis process first of analysis and then of abstraction of similars is\\nthe essential part of every act of reasoning.\\n\\nIn intuitive or unreasoned judgment, on the other hand, we\\njump to the conclusion without analyzing the intermediate steps.\\nIf I say, _I have a feeling in my bones that it will rain to-morrow,_\\nor, _it is borne in on me that our team will win_, the sensations and\\nideas that I thus lump together are too subtle and too complex for\\nanalysis, and the conclusion, though it may prove sound, is not\\narrived at by reasoning. The difference between such intuitive\\nand unreasoned judgments, and reasoning properly so called, lies\\nin the absence or the presence of the intermediate step by which\\nwe consciously recognize and choose out some single attribute or\\ncharacteristic of the fact or facts we are considering, and pass\\nfrom that to other cases in which it occurs.\\n\\nThe skill of the reasoner therefore consists of two parts: first, the\\nsagacity to pick out of the complex fact before him, the attribute or\\ncharacteristic which is significant for his present purpose; and second,\\nthe large knowledge of the subject which will enable him to follow it\\ninto other cases in which it occurs with different circumstances, or, in\\nother words, to follow a similarity through diverse cases. Darwin\\'s\\ngreat achievement in establishing the principle of evolution lay first\\nin the scientific sagacity which flashed home on him, after years of\\npatient study, that the one common fact in all the multitude of plants\\nand animals is that in the struggle for existence by which all living\\nbeings persist, those who are best fitted to their circumstances\\nsurvive; and second, in his rich knowledge of the world of nature, which\\nmade it possible for him to follow out this characteristic in all kinds\\nof plants and animals, and so to reach the general law. But whether it\\nbe so world-sweeping a conclusion as his, or my conclusion that my dog\\nhas killed a hen, the process is the same: analysis or breaking up of\\nthe complex fact, and following out the consequences or implications of\\nsome selected part of it into other cases.\\n\\nAll reasoning thus reduces itself in the end to a process of passing\\nfrom like to like: we notice that the present case is like other cases\\nwhich we already know: then, since these cases have always in the past\\nbeen accompanied by certain circumstances or consequences, we believe\\nthat the present case will also show these same circumstances or\\nconsequences. Whenever my dog has killed when the cases have been\\nsimilar in the blood and feathers on his mouth; in this case he has\\nblood and feathers on his mouth; therefore he must have killed a hen.\\nIndividual plants and animals survive which are fitted to their\\nenvironment by special characteristics, and those which are not so\\nfitted die; species of plants and animals, as well as individuals, show\\nspecial adaptation to their environment; therefore species have survived\\nthrough the same process of natural selection.\\n\\nIt follows that reasoning, whether it results in a general law or in\\nconcrete judgment, depends on the assumption that nature--and in nature\\nwe mean here the whole universe as we know it is uniform; that there are\\nties between facts which make it possible for us to be certain that if a\\ngiven fact occurs, then another fact always occurs with it as an effect,\\nor as a cause, or connected with it in some other manner. Without this\\ncertainty of the uniformity of things there would be no reasoning, and\\ntherefore no argument from indirect evidence. Huxley sets forth this\\nfundamental truth clearly and impressively at the beginning of the first\\nof his \"Lectures on Evolution\" (see p. 234).\\n\\nFor practical purposes the various types of this inference from\\nsimilarity can be conveniently thrown into three groups. As will be\\nobvious, there is no fixed and impassable line between them.\\n\\n\"If an inference relies upon a resemblance that is newly seen, rare, or\\ndoubtful, it is called an inference from analogy; if it is made upon the\\nbasis of an established classification, it is called a generalization;\\nif it involves a variety of resemblances so combined as to bear upon a\\nsingle point, it is usually or frequently called an inference from\\ncircumstantial evidence.\"[25]\\n\\nI will take up each of these types and show how we use them in the\\npractical work of argument. It will be seen that they vary greatly in\\ncertainty of results.\\n\\n34. Reasoning from Analogy. Analogy in its most tenuous form is\\nweak as a basis for an actual inference, though it is often effective as\\na means of expressing an intuitive judgment where the reasons are too\\nsubtle and diffused for formal explanation. When Lincoln in the middle\\nof the Civil War said that men do not swap horses while they are\\ncrossing a stream, the analog, though subtle, was felt to be real.\\nPopular adages and proverbs are common modes of expressing such\\ndeep-lying analogies: for example, \"Where there is smoke there is fire\";\\n\"The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way.\" Poetry too is full\\nof these subtle, pregnant similarities which link things in some one\\naspect, but fail for all others.\\n\\n                          To die; to sleep;\\n    No more; and by a sleep to say we end\\n    The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks\\n    That flesh is heir to. \\'Tis a consummation\\n    Devoutly to be wish\\'d. To die; to sleep;--\\n    To sleep? Perchance to dream! Ay, there\\'s the rub;\\n    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\\n    When we have shuffl\\'d off this mortal coil,\\n    Must give us pause.\\n\\nBut, as in this case of Hamlet\\'s, poetical analogies will not bear much\\nstrain; the aspect in which the similarity holds is usually the only\\naspect the two cases have in common, and to take poetry as a precise\\nformulation of fact is to sin against both humor and sound reasoning.\\n\\nIn daily life we are constantly reasoning by analogy. If you argue that\\na certain man who has been successful at the head of a railroad will\\ntherefore make a good president for a college because that also is a\\ncomplex institution, or that because self-government has worked well in\\na certain school it will probably work well in a college, or that\\nbecause a friend has been cured of sleeplessness by taking a walk just\\nbefore going to bed therefore everybody who sleeps badly can be cured in\\nthe same way,--in all these cases you are reasoning by analogy. In each\\ncase it will be noticed you would pass from a similarity which exists in\\na single case or in a small number of cases to the conclusion. The\\nreasoning is sound, however, only in so far as the similarity bears on\\nthe actual purpose in hand: in the first example, if the success of the\\nrailroad president arises from the power of understanding men and of\\nphilosophic insight into large problems, the reasoning will probably be\\nvalid; in the last example, if applied to insomnia due to overwork, it\\nmight be bad.\\n\\nIn practical affairs it is easy to find examples of reasoning from\\nanalogy, especially in arguments of policy. The first trial of city\\ngovernment by commission depended on such reasoning: when Galveston,\\nTexas, was devastated by a storm it was reasoned that in business\\nmatters a small body of picked men with absolute powers are most\\nefficient in an emergency, and that since the reconstruction of the city\\nwas essentially a matter of business, such a body would best meet the\\nemergency. So the extension of commission government in other states at\\nfirst followed reasoning by analogy: government by commission worked\\nwell in Galveston; it would probably work well in Des Moines. In the\\nsame way with the arguments for a parcels post: they proceed from the\\nanalogy of the present postal service, which has been successful so far\\nas it goes, and from the success of the parcels post in almost all the\\ncountries of Europe. If you were arguing that \"Association\" (or\\n\"soccer\") football should be made one of the major sports at your\\ncollege, you would reason from the analogy of its great popularity with\\nEnglishmen all over the world that it would also probably be popular in\\nAmerica.\\n\\nWhen you use the argument from analogy, however, you must make sure that\\nthe similarity between the two cases runs to the point you wish to\\nestablish. In the following extract from an argument in favor of\\ncommission government for all cities, the author explicitly limits his\\nreasoning from the analogy of Washington to the point of the extension\\nof the system to large cities.\\n\\nIf we look for successful governments by commission in this\\ncountry, it is not difficult to find them in our largest cities. The\\ncity of Washington is governed by a small commission, and is\\nacknowledged to be one of our best-governed cities. While this\\ncommission originated in an entirely different way from that of the\\ncommission form of government, successful administration under its rule\\nis a valid answer to the argument that small commissions are suited only\\nto the administration of small cities.[26]\\n\\nWhenever you use this type of reasoning, it is wise thus to limit its\\nbearing. If in an argument in favor of allowing secret societies in a\\nhigh school you rely on the analogy of college life, take pains to show\\nthat the resemblance covers the social life of a school. If you were\\narguing that your city should establish a municipal gymnasium, and\\nrelied on the reasoning from the analogy of a family, in which all the\\nmembers have a direct interest in the health of the others, show that\\nthis interest has practical grounds of welfare, and does not rest wholly\\non affection. In every case, unless the limits of the analogy are\\nobvious, specify them in order to carry your readers safely with you.\\n\\n35. False Analogy. A peculiar danger of the argument from analogy\\nis the fallacy which is known as false analogy, or reasoning to a\\nconclusion which the similarity does not support. Arguments in which\\nthere are many figures of speech, especially when the style is at all\\nflorid, are apt to slop over into this fallacy. To liken education to\\nthe unfolding of a flower is all very well, if you do not go on to argue\\nthat because the lily of the field neither toils nor spins, therefore a\\nchild should do no work in school. It is said that M. Stolypin, the\\nlate premier of Russia, once half apologized In the Duma for the\\nslowness of his reforms, saying that he Was like a man shooting with a\\nflintlock musket; to which one of the Liberal members replied that it\\nwas not a question of weapons, but of aim, and that if his Excellency\\nwas to go on shooting at the people, it would be better if he went on\\nusing flintlocks. Under the auspices of the Carnegie Institution an\\nexpert in business administration made an inquiry into the methods of\\nteaching and research in physics at various American universities, and\\nmade recommendations based on the conduct of business establishments. A\\nprofessor of physics in answer showed in how many ways the analogy\\nbetween a business concern, whose end is profit, and a physical\\nlaboratory, whose end is the advancement of knowledge, is false and\\nmisleading. The expert had suggested a general research board to\\ncorrelate researches; the professor cited the cases of Airy, the\\nastronomer royal of England, who by his dominating position held back\\nastronomical research in England for a generation, and of Sir Humphry\\nDavy, who discouraged the work of Faraday, when the latter was his\\nassistant.\\n\\nThe expert suggested that apparatus could be passed on from\\none investigator to another: the professor replied that few men can use\\napparatus designed for some one else\\'s purpose, and that the cost of\\nreconstruction would exceed the cost of new machines. In short, he\\ncompletely riddled the argument from analogy set up by the expert.[27]\\n\\nA notable example of conclusive refutation of an argument based on a\\nfalse analogy is to be found in William James\\'s Ingersoll Lecture on\\nImmortality. He took up the ordinary argument against the immortality of\\nthe soul, which, starting from the accepted physiological and\\npsychological formula, \"Thought is a function of the brain,\" reasons\\nthat therefore when the brain dies and decays, thought and consciousness\\ndie, too.\\n\\nThis, then, is the objection to immortality; and the next thing in\\norder for me is to try to make plain to you why I believe that it has in\\nstrict logic no deterrent power. I must show you that the fatal\\nconsequence is not coercive, as is commonly imagined; and that, even\\nthough our soul\\'s life (as here below it is revealed to us) may be in\\nliteral strictness the function of a brain that perishes, yet it is not\\nat all impossible, but on the contrary quite possible, that the life may\\nstill continue when the brain itself is dead.\\n\\nThe supposed impossibility of its continuing comes from too superficial\\na look at the admitted fact of functional dependence. The moment we\\ninquire more closely into the notion of functional dependence, and ask\\nourselves, for example, how many kinds of functional dependence there\\nmay be, we immediately perceive that there is one kind at least that\\ndoes not exclude a life hereafter at all. The fatal conclusion of the\\nphysiologist flows from his assuming offhand another kind of functional\\ndependence, and treating it as the only imaginable kind.\\n\\nWhen the physiologist who thinks that his science cuts off all hope of\\nimmortality pronounces the phrase, \"Thought is a function of the brain,\"\\nhe thinks of the matter just as he thinks when he says, \"Steam is a\\nfunction of the teakettle,\" \"Light is a function of the electric\\ncircuit,\" \"Power is a function of the moving waterfall.\" In these latter\\ncases the several material objects have the function of inwardly\\ncreating or engendering their effects, and their function must be called\\n_productive_ function. Just so, he thinks, it must be with the brain.\\nEngendering consciousness in its interior, much as it engenders\\ncholesterin and creatin and carbonic acid, its relation to our soul\\'s\\nlife must also be called productive function. Of course, if such\\nproduction be the function, then when the organ perishes, since the\\nproduction can no longer continue, the soul must surely die. Such a\\nconclusion as this is indeed inevitable from that particular conception\\nof the facts.\\n\\nRut in the world of physical nature productive function of this sort is\\nnot the only kind of function with which we are familiar. We have also\\nreleasing or permissive function; and we have transmissive function.\\n\\nThe trigger of a crossbow has a releasing function: it removes the\\nobstacle that holds the string, and lets the bow fly back to its natural\\nshape. So when the hammer falls upon a detonating compound. By knocking\\nout the inner molecular obstructions, it lets the constituent gases\\nresume their normal bulk, and so permits the explosion to take place.\\n\\nIn the case of a  glass, a prism, or a refracting lens, we have\\ntransmissive function. The energy of the light, no matter how produced,\\nis by the glass sifted and limited in color, and by the lens or prism\\ndetermined to a certain path and shape. Similarly, the keys of an organ\\nhave only a transmissive function. They open successively the various\\npipes and let the wind in the air chest escape in various ways. The\\nvoices of the various pipes are constituted by the columns of air\\ntrembling as they emerge. But the air is not engendered in the organ.\\nThe organ proper, as distinguished from its air chest, is only an\\napparatus for letting portions of It loose upon the world in these\\npeculiarly limited shapes.\\n\\nMy thesis now is this: that, when we think of the law that thought is a\\nfunction of the brain, we are not required to think of productive\\nfunction only; _we are entitled also to consider permissive or\\ntransmissive function_. And this the ordinary psychophysiologist leaves\\nout of account.[28]\\n\\nThe question of the validity of an analogy in reasoning is always, as\\nhere, whether the similarity on which the reasoning rests really runs\\nbetween the two cases in hand, or is not merely a general resemblance\\nexpressed by some phrase or word which seems to mean more than it does.\\nIn other words, when you are testing an analogy, whether your own or an\\nopponent\\'s, make sure that the similarity is real for the present case.\\nA picturesque figure of speech may add life to an argument, but it may\\nalso cover a gap in the reasoning.\\n\\n36. Reasoning by Classification or Generalization. Obviously the\\nstrength of reasoning from analogy increases with the number of cases\\nwhich you can point to as showing the similarity on which you rely, for\\nyou can then begin to generalize and classify.\\n\\nAnalogy expresses our natural tendency to assimilate the new to the old,\\nto interpret what is strange and unfamiliar in the light of what we\\nalready know. It may therefore be described as classification in the\\nmaking. The resemblances which guide us are called analogies so long as\\nthey are newly seen, rare, or doubtful; but as the number of cases\\nincreases, analogy passes by insensible stages into established\\nclassification.[29]\\n\\nAn excellent example of this transition may be seen in the present state\\nof the argument in favor of commission government: at first, as we have\\nseen, it depended chiefly on reasoning from analogy; by this time enough\\ncities have adopted the plan to make it possible to classify them, and\\nso reason by generalization.\\n\\nGeneralization and classification, it may be noted in passing, are two\\naspects of the same process of thought. When one passes from the\\nindividual facts to the larger fact which brings them together, as in\\nthe assertion, _Members of the Phi Beta Kappa are good scholars_, one\\nmakes a generalization; when one asserts of an individual the larger\\nfact, as in the assertion, My _brother is a good scholar_ (My _brother\\nbelongs to the class Good Scholars_), one makes a classification.\\n\\nWhen a classification or generalization is constant and familiar, it\\nbrings forth, by the natural economy of language, a name for the class\\nor the principle; \"federation,\" \"deciduous trees,\" \"emotion,\" \"terminal\\nmoraine,\" are all names of classes; \"attraction of gravity,\" \"erosion,\"\\n\"degeneration,\" \"natural selection,\" are names of principles which sum\\nup acts of generalization. Almost always these names begin as figures of\\nspeech, but where they are used accurately they have a perfectly exact\\nmeaning. Darwin has given some account of this process of language:\\n\\n\"It has been said that I speak of natural selection as an active power\\nor deity, but who objects to an author speaking of the attraction of\\ngravity as ruling the movements of planets? Every one knows what is\\nmeant by such metaphorical expressions, and they are almost necessary\\nfor brevity: so, again, it is difficult to avoid personifying the word\\n\\'Nature.\\' But I mean by Nature the aggregate action and product of many\\nlaws, and by laws the sequence of events as ascertained by us.\"[30]\\n\\nWhen the facts intended to be meant by a phrase are thus carefully\\nspecified and delimited, the phrase ceases to be a figure of speech, and\\nbecomes the name of a class or of a principle.\\n\\nGeneralization and classification always take place for purposes of\\nreasoning;[31] and reasoning which is dependent on them rests on the\\nassumption that things are uniformly correlated in nature; when we\\nthrow things together into classes we assume that what is true for one\\nmember of a class, so far as it is a member of that class, is true to\\nthe same extent and for the purpose for which the class is made for all\\nother members of that class.\\n\\nIn practice a large part of our reasoning is through generalization and\\nclassification; and as we have seen, it has a more substantial basis\\nthan when we rest on an analogy. If you hear that your brother has been\\nelected to the Phi Beta Kappa, you reason from the generalization that\\nall members of the Phi Beta Kappa are high scholars to the inference\\nthat your brother must have taken high rank. When I see a gang of\\ncarpenters knocking off work at four o\\'clock in the afternoon, I infer\\nthat they must belong to the union, because I know that unions as a\\nclass have established an eight-hour day. If you were arguing that the\\nstandards for graduation from your college should be raised, you would\\ntry to show that each year enough men are graduated with low\\nintellectual attainments to make a class large enough to generalize\\nfrom. If you were arguing that your city should establish a municipal\\ngymnasium, you would try to show that of the boys and young men brought\\nbefore the police courts for petty mischief and more serious offenses\\nalmost all have lacked the chance to work off their animal spirits in a\\nhealthy way. Wherever you can thus establish your special case in a\\nclass which has known characteristics or consequences, you can then\\napply the characteristics and consequences of the class to your special\\ncase.\\n\\nWhere the class is recognized as having definite characteristics or\\nconsequences, you can make your inference by showing that your case\\nfalls within the class. Sometimes the stress of your reasoning will come\\non making it clear that the consequence or characteristic on which your\\nreasoning depends really belongs to the class. If, for example, you were\\narguing, as did the Class of \\'85 at Amherst College, that your college\\nshould return to something like the old-fashioned classical education,\\nyou would try to establish the fact that men who have had the\\nold-fashioned classical education are as a rule characterized by\\nintelligence, liberal culture, and open-mindedness. In such cases it is\\nthe generalization on which the class is based which is the difficult\\npart of your task.\\n\\nIn general, however, if you can show your readers that the present case\\nbelongs in a class of cases which can be recognized as belonging\\ntogether by virtue of definable characteristics, you have established an\\nexcellent foundation for an inference based on those characteristics.\\n\\n37. Reasoning by Causal Relation. Reasoning by generalization rises\\ngreatly in certainty, however, whenever you can show the workings of\\ncause and effect. If a college receives every year from a certain school\\na number of boys who are slack and lazy students, the dean of that\\ncollege may come to generalize and expect most of the boys from that\\nschool to be poor timber. If, however, he finds that the master of the\\nschool will take and keep any boy who lives in the town, he is able to\\nargue from this as a cause to the conclusion that the standards of the\\nschool are low, and then from these low standards as a cause to the poor\\nquality of the graduates of the school.\\n\\nHere is another example, from Professor James:\\n\\n    I am sitting in a railroad car, waiting for the train to start. It\\n    is winter, and the stove fills the car with pungent smoke. The\\n    brakeman enters, and my neighbor asks him to \"stop that stove\\n    smoking.\" He replies that it will stop entirely as soon as the car\\n    begins to move. \"Why so?\" asks the passenger. \"It _always_ does,\"\\n    replies the brakeman. It is evident from this \"always\" that the\\n    connection between car moving and smoke stopping was a purely\\n    empirical one in the brakeman\\'s mind, bred of habit. But if the\\n    passenger had been an acute reasoner ... [and had] singled out of\\n    all the numerous points involved in a stove\\'s not smoking the one\\n    special point of smoke pouring freely out of the stove-pipe\\'s mouth,\\n    he would probably ... have been immediately reminded of the law that\\n    a fluid passes more rapidly out of a pipe\\'s mouth if another fluid\\n    be at the same time streaming over that mouth.[32]\\n\\nHere the passenger\\'s certainty that the smoking would stop would have\\nbeen much increased if he had, as Professor James suggests, reasoned to\\nthe cause, instead of trusting to the brakeman\\'s generalization from\\nexperience.\\n\\nIn scientific matters search for cause and effect the chief mode of\\nprogress. General Sternberg\\'s article \"Yellow Fever and Mosquitoes\"\\n(p. 251) is an admirable account of this advance from probability to\\ncertainty, which comes from demonstrating the necessary sequence which\\nwe call cause and effect. When Major Reed and his associates had shown\\nthat in cases where mosquitoes were kept away there was no yellow fever,\\nbut that in cases where infected mosquitoes were allowed to bite\\npatients yellow fever followed, they turned the probability that\\nmosquitoes were the transmitting agent of the fever into a certainty.\\nLikewise with the glacial theory: it had already in the time of the\\nelder Professor Agassiz been established that certain regions of\\nnorthern Europe and America could be classed together by the occurrence\\nof certain phenomena--rounded hills, ledges of rock smoothed off and\\nmarked with scratches running more or less north and south, deposits of\\nclean gravel and sand, boulders of various foreign kinds of rock\\nscattered over the surface of the country; when he showed that glaciers\\nin their movements produce all these phenomena, he laid bare the cause\\nof the phenomena, and so demonstrated with practical certainty the\\ntheory of the former existence of a huge glacial sheet in the northern\\nhemisphere. Wherever you can show that your case not only belongs to a\\nrecognized class of cases, with recognized characteristics, but also\\nthat in those characteristics there is a necessary sequence of cause and\\neffect, you have proved your point.\\n\\nIn the example above, of an argument for the establishment of a\\nmunicipal gymnasium, if after showing that all the boys and young men\\nwho get into the courts have no normal and healthy way of working off\\ntheir natural animal spirits, you can show that in places where through\\nsettlements or municipal action gymnasiums have been provided, the\\nnumber of arrests of boys and young men has greatly fallen off, you have\\nestablished the grounds for an inference of cause and effect which gives\\nyour argument a wholly new strength. In the case of the argument for a\\nreturn to a classical course in a college, this sequence of cause and\\neffect would be very difficult to establish, for here you would be deep\\ndown in the most complex and subtle region of human nature. Wherever it\\nis possible, however, lead the inference from a classification or\\ngeneralization on to an inference of cause and effect.\\n\\n38. Induction and Deduction. Our next step is to consider how we\\nget the generalizations on which we base so much of our reasoning. As we\\nhave seen, the science which deals with the making of them, with their\\nbasis, and with the rules which govern inferences made from them is\\nlogic.\\n\\nLogicians generally distinguish between two branches of their science,\\ninductive and deductive reasoning. In inductive reasoning we pass from\\nindividual facts to general principles; in deductive reasoning we pass\\nfrom general principles to conclusions about individual facts. The\\ndistinction, however, draws less interest in recent times than formerly,\\nand logicians of the present generation tend to doubt whether it has any\\nvital significance.[33] They point out that in practice we\\nintermingle the two kinds almost inextricably, that the distinction\\nbetween facts and principles is temporary and shifting, and that we\\ncannot fit some of the common forms of inference into these categories\\nwithout difficult and complicated restatement.\\n\\nNevertheless, as deductive logic and inductive logic are ancient and\\ntime-honored terms which have become a part of the vocabulary of\\neducated men, it is worth while to take some note of the distinction\\nbetween them, I shall not attempt here to do more than to explain a few\\nof the more important principles. I shall begin with inductive logic,\\nsince that is the branch which deals with the making of generalizations\\nfrom individual fact, and therefore that which has most concern in the\\narguments of the average man in his passage through life.\\n\\n39. Inductive Reasoning. In inductive reasoning we put individual\\nfacts and cases together into a class on the basis of some definable\\nsimilarity, and then infer from them a general principle. The types of\\ninductive reasoning have been reduced by logicians to certain canons,\\nbut these reduce themselves to two main methods, which depend on whether\\nin a given piece of reasoning we start from the likeness between the\\ninstances or the differences between them. On these two methods, the\\nmethod of agreement and the method of difference, hang all the processes\\nof modern science, and most of our everyday arguments.\\n\\nThe method of agreement has been defined as follows:\\n\\nIf two or more instances of the phenomenon under investigation have\\nonly one circumstance in common, the circumstance in which alone all the\\ninstances agree is the cause (or effect) of the given phenomenon.[34]\\n\\nA few examples, which might easily be multiplied, will show how\\nconstantly we use this method in everyday life. Suppose that a teacher\\nis annoyed at somewhat irregular intervals by whispering and laughing in\\nthe back of the schoolroom, for which he can find no cause, but that\\npresently he notices that whenever a certain pair of boys sit together\\nthere the trouble begins; he infers that these two boys are the cause of\\nthe trouble.\\n\\nIn the old days before it had been discovered that the germs of malaria\\nare carried by mosquitoes, the disease was ascribed to a miasma which\\nfloated over low ground at night; and the innkeepers of the Roman\\nCampagna, where malaria had almost driven out the population, urged\\ntheir guests never to leave their windows open at night, for fear of\\nletting in the miasma. In the lights of those days this was good\\nreasoning by the method of agreement, for it was common observation that\\nof all the many kinds of people who slept with their windows open most\\nhad malaria. We are constantly using this method in cases of this sort,\\nwhere from observation we are sure that a single cause is at work under\\ndiverse circumstances. If the cases are numerous enough and diverse\\nenough, we arrive at a safe degree of certainty for practical purposes.\\nAs the case just cited shows, however, the method does not establish a\\ncause with great certainty. No matter how many cases we gather, if a\\nwhole new field related to the subject happens to be opened up, the\\nagreement may be shattered.\\n\\nThe method of difference, which in some cases does establish causes with\\nas great certainty as is possible for human fallibility, works in the\\nopposite way: instead of collecting a large number of cases and noting\\nthe single point of agreement, it takes a single case and varies a\\nsingle one of its elements. The method has been stated as follows:\\n\\nIf an instance in which the phenomenon occurs, and an instance in which\\nit does not occur, have every circumstance in common save one, that one\\noccurring only in the former; the circumstance in which alone the two\\ninstances differ, is the effect, or the cause, or an indispensable part\\nof the cause, of the phenomenon.[35]\\n\\nThe principle is clearer and more apprehensible in the concrete example\\nthan in the abstract statement; as a matter of fact it is applied in\\nevery experimental search for a cause. The Agricultural College of New\\nYork, for example, in the course of certain experiments on apple\\norchards, bought an orchard which had not been yielding well, and\\ndivided it into halves; one half was then kept plowed and cultivated,\\nthe other half was left in grass; otherwise the treatment was the same.\\nWhen the half which was kept cultivated gave a much larger yield than\\nthe other, it was safe to infer that the cultivation was the cause of\\nthe heavier yield. Dr. Ehrlich, the great German pathologist, is said to\\nhave tried six hundred and five different substances before he found one\\nwhich would kill the germ of a certain disease; in each experiment he\\nwas using the method of difference, keeping the conditions the same in\\nall except a single point, which was the addition of the substance used\\nin that particular experiment. Wherever the conditions of an experiment\\ncan be thus controlled, the method of difference gives a very accurate\\nway of discovering causes. With advancing knowledge a supposed cause may\\nbe in turn analyzed in such a way that each of its parts can be\\nseparately varied, in order to come more closely to the actual sequence\\ninvolved.\\n\\nIt has been pointed out[36] that the two methods are really statements\\nof what is required for the verification of a theory at two stages of\\nits growth: when we are first getting a glimpse of a causal connection\\nbetween two facts we collect all the cases in which they occur in as\\nmuch variety as possible, to see if the connection is really universal;\\nthen, having established the universal sequence, we come to close\\nquarters with it in a single critical instance, varying the conditions\\nsingly until we run down the one without which the effect cannot take\\nplace.\\n\\nNo neater and more illuminating example of this relation between the two\\nmethods and the successful working of them can be found than that in the\\narticle by General Steinberg, \"Yellow Fever and Mosquitoes\" (p. 251).\\nIn that case first Dr. Carlos Finlay of Havana, and then Dr. Sternberg\\nhimself, had become convinced by comparing many cases of yellow fever\\nthat there was some intermediate host for the bacillus that caused the\\ndisease. This conclusion they reached through the method of agreement.\\nDr. Finlay\\'s experiments by the method of difference had failed,\\nhowever, indisputably to establish the cause, since he did not see that\\nit was necessary to allow the bacillus at least twelve days for\\nincubation in the body of the mosquito. The final and definitive proof,\\nwhich came through the splendid self-devotion of the surgeons in charge\\nof the experiment and of certain enlisted men who volunteered to be made\\nthe subject of the experiment, was by the method of difference. These\\nbrave men allowed themselves to be exposed to mosquitoes which had\\nalready bitten patients suffering from the fever, and they promptly came\\ndown with the disease; one of them, Dr. Lazear, gave his life for his\\ndevotion to the cause of his fellow men. Then other men were exposed in\\na mosquito-proof room to clothes and other articles brought directly\\nfrom yellow-fever patients, and showed no ill effects. Thus it was\\nabsolutely proved, though the bacillus itself had not been found, that\\nyellow fever is carried by mosquitoes, and is not carried by ordinary\\ncontagion.\\n\\nThe unsuccessful experiments of Dr. Finlay and the later success of\\nMajor Reed show how science advances by refinement of analysis in the\\nuse of the method. The hypothesis on which the former worked was that\\nall mosquitoes who had bitten a yellow-fever patient can carry the\\ndisease. Dr. Reed and his associates analyzed the phenomenon more\\nclosely and tried their experiments on the hypothesis that only\\nmosquitoes who have lived twelve days after biting the patient are\\ncapable of passing on the disease. This refinement of analysis and\\nobservation is the chief mode of advance in the sciences which depend on\\nexperiment.\\n\\nScientific arguments, therefore, make constant use of both methods.\\nMedical research frequently begins with the gathering of statistics from\\nreported cases, and the theory or theories suggested by the method of\\nagreement working on these facts leads to the application of the method\\nof difference through some series of critical experiments. In general\\nthe conclusions of science where experiment cannot be used depend on the\\nmethod of agreement, especially in the larger theories in biology and\\ngeology, where the lapse of unnumbered centuries is necessary to bring\\nabout changes. In physics, in chemistry, in medicine, on the other hand,\\ncritical experiments are generally possible, and so progress is by the\\nmethod of difference. In such subjects as political science and\\ngovernment, where experiment is out of the question, one must depend\\nchiefly on the method of agreement, except in such cases as will be\\nmentioned below where a change in policy has the same effect as an\\nexperiment. Here, however, one must not forget that in all matters human\\nthe incalculable clement of human nature enters to complicate all\\nresults, and that emotion and feeling are always irrational.\\n\\nIt is by the same processes that we get most of our explanations of the\\nworld as we go through it, and most of the facts on which we base\\njudgment and action. When the same sort of thing happens in a number of\\nfairly different cases, we begin to suspect that there is a reason; and\\nif we are going to make an argument on the subject, we take note of the\\ncases and try in some way to arrange and tabulate them. The supporters\\nof a protective tariff collect instances of prosperity under such a\\ntariff, the supporters of free trade cases of prosperity under free\\ntrade, the believers in the classical education cases of men trained in\\nthat way who have attained to eminence, believers in the elective system\\ncases of men who are the products of that system who have attained equal\\neminence. In most cases such collection of instances does not carry you\\nfar toward a coercive argument; the cases are too complex for you to\\nassert that any one factor is the cause of the result.\\n\\nIn another kind of case you can come a little nearer. In an argument for\\nthe establishment of a commission form of government in a given city or\\ntown there are now enough cases of this type of government in practice\\nto make possible a good argument by the method of agreement; the places\\nare scattered over the country, north and south, east and west, and\\nrange greatly in size and environments; and all of them so far (1911)\\nreport improvement in efficiency and honesty of government. Accordingly\\nit is a fair presumption that the improvement is due to the introduction\\nof the new form of government, since in all other respects the places\\nwhich have tried it have little in common.\\n\\nA more important result of the inquiry is to lead us on to an\\napplication of the method of difference. Starting with this strong\\nprobability that the improvement is due to the new form of government,\\nwe can go a step further and examine a single case, in order to\\nestablish more clearly the sequence of events which we call a cause. In\\nthe case of any given town which has adopted the commission government\\nthe material for the application of the method of difference is ready to\\nour hands, if nothing else has been changed in the town but the form of\\ngovernment. The inhabitants and the voters are the same, the physical\\nconditions are the same. If now we seek for the cause of an admitted\\nimprovement in the administration of the city affairs, we are driven to\\nascribe it to the only factor in the case which has been changed, and\\nthis is the form of government. Such an argument, if supported by\\nfigures and specific facts, is obviously strong.\\n\\nThe same kind of argument is constantly used in the discussion of\\nprohibition and local option as a means of reducing the amount of liquor\\nconsumed in a community, for the frequent changes both in states and in\\nsmaller communities provide material for the application of the same\\nmethod of difference. Here, however, the factors are more complex, on\\naccount of differences in the character of the population in different\\nplaces, and their inherited habits as concerns the use of wine, beer,\\nand other liquors.\\n\\n40. Faulty Generalization. Both generalization through the method\\nof agreement, and the assignment of causes through the method of\\ndifference, however, have their dangers, like all forms of reasoning. A\\ndiscussion of these dangers will throw light on the processes\\nthemselves.\\n\\nThe chief danger when you reason through the method of agreement is of\\njumping to a conclusion too soon, and before you have collected enough\\ncases for a safe conclusion. This is to commit the fallacy known as\\nhasty generalization. It is the error committed by the dogmatic sort of\\nglobetrotter, who after six weeks spent in Swiss-managed hotels in Italy\\nwill supply you with a full set of opinions on the government, morals,\\nand customs of the country. In a less crass form it affects the judgment\\nof most Englishmen who write books about this country, for they come\\nover with letters of introduction to New York, Boston, Chicago, and San\\nFrancisco, and then generalize about the rest of the country and its\\npopulation.\\n\\nWe are all in danger from the fallacy, however, for it is a necessary\\nlaw of the mind that we shall begin to make opinions and judgments on a\\nsubject as soon as we become acquainted with it. The only safeguards\\nare, in the first place, to keep these preliminary judgments tentative\\nand fluid, and in the second, to keep them to one\\'s self until there is\\nsome need of expressing them. The path to wisdom in action is through\\nopen-mindedness and caution.\\n\\nWhen one has to refute an argument in which there is faulty\\ngeneralization, it is often easy to point out that its author had no\\nsufficient time or chance to make observations, or to point out that the\\ninstances on which he relied are not fair examples of their class. In\\npractice the strength of an argument in which this error is to be found\\nlies largely in the positiveness with which it is pronounced; for it is\\nhuman nature to accept opinions which have an outward appearance of\\ncertainty.\\n\\nA not uncommon form of faulty generalization is to base an argument on a\\nmere enumeration of similar cases. This is a poor foundation for an\\nargument, especially for a probability in the future, unless the\\nenumeration approaches an exhaustive list of all possible cases. To have\\nreasoned a few years ago that because Yale had beaten Harvard at rowing\\nalmost every year for fifteen years it had a permanent superiority in\\nthe strength and skill of its oarsmen would have been dangerous, for\\nwhen the years before the given period were looked up they would have\\nshown results the other way. And an enumeration may run through a very\\nlong period of time, and still in the end be upset.\\n\\nTo an inhabitant of Central Africa fifty years ago, no fact probably\\nappeared to rest on more uniform experience than this, that all human\\nbeings are black. To Europeans not many years ago, the proposition, \\'All\\nswans are white,\\' appeared an equally unequivocal instance of uniformity\\nin the course of nature. Further experience has proved to both that they\\nwere mistaken; but they had to wait fifty centuries for this experience.\\nDuring that long time, mankind believed in an uniformity of the course\\nof nature where no such uniformity really existed.[37]\\n\\nUnless you have so wide and complete a view of your subject that you can\\npractically insure your enumeration as exhaustive, it is not safe to\\nreason that because a thing has always happened so in the past, it will\\nalways happen so in the future. The notorious difficulty of proving a\\nnegative goes back to this principle.\\n\\nSo closely like hasty generalization that it cannot be clearly separated\\nfrom it is faulty reasoning that arises from neglecting exceptions to a\\ngeneral principle. All our generalizations, except those that are so\\nnear truisms as to be barren of interest, are more or less rough and\\nready, and the process of refining them is a process of finding\\nexceptions and restating the principle so that it will meet the case of\\nthe exceptions.\\n\\nDarwin is said to have had \"the power of never letting exceptions pass\\nunnoticed. Every one notices a fact as an exception when it is striking\\nor frequent, but he had a special instinct for arresting an\\nexception.\"[38] It was this instinct which made him so cautious and\\ntherefore so sure in the statement of his hypotheses: after the idea of\\nnatural selection as an explanation of the origin of the species of the\\nnatural world had occurred to him, he spent twenty years collecting\\nfurther facts and verifying observations to test the theory before he\\ngave it to the world. A generalization that the republican form of\\ngovernment produces greater peace and prosperity than the monarchical\\nwould neglect the obvious exceptions in the Central American republics;\\nand to make it at all tenable the generalization would have to have some\\nsuch proviso as, \"among peoples of Germanic race.\" Even then the\\nexceptions would be more numerous than the cases which would fall within\\nthe rule.[39] One must cultivate respect for facts in making theories: a\\ntheory should always be held so tentatively that any new or unnoticed\\nfacts can have their due influence in altering it.\\n\\nOf the errors in reasoning about a cause none is more common than that\\nknown by the older logic as _post hoc, ergo propter hoc_ (after this,\\ntherefore on account of it), or more briefly, the _post hoc_ fallacy.\\nAll of us who have a pet remedy for a cold probably commit this fallacy\\ntwo times out of three when we declare that our quinine or rhinitis or\\ncamphor pill has cured us; for as a wise old doctor of two generations\\nago declared, and as the new doctrines of medical research are making\\nclear, in nine cases out of ten nature cures.\\n\\nOf the same character are the common superstitions of daily life, for\\nexample, that if thirteen sit at table together one will die within the\\nyear, or that crossing a funeral procession brings misfortune. Where\\nsuch superstitions are more than playfully held, they are gross cases of\\ncalling that a cause which has no relation to the event. Here is another\\nexample, from a letter to _The Nation:_[40]\\n\\nIn the last volume of the Shakespeare controversy, the argument\\npresented \"To the Reader\" seems fairly to be summarized as follows: The\\nplays are recognized as wonderful; scholars are amazed at the knowledge\\nof the classes in them, lawyers at the law, travelers at the minute\\naccuracy of the descriptions of foreign cities; they show a keen critic\\nof court etiquette and French soldiery; the only possible man of the\\ntime with this encyclopedic outlook was Francis Bacon. Both in the\\noriginal and in the summary there seems a _casual_ connection implied,\\nnamely, that the plays are wonderful because of the knowledge, and\\nbecause of the knowledge Bacon is the author. But, stated thus baldly,\\nthe fallacy is obvious. It is not because the author \"had by study\\nobtained nearly all the learning that could be gained from books\" that\\nthe Elizabethans went to see the plays, or that we to-day read them; but\\nit is because there is to be found in them wonderful characterization\\nexpressed dramatically, namely, before an audience. And this audience is\\nwhat the scholars seem to forget. For by it is the dramatist limited,\\nsince profundity of thought or skill in allusion is good or bad,\\nartistically, exactly in proportion as the thought is comprehended or\\nthe allusion understood.\\n\\nSometimes this fallacy is caused by assuming that because a certain\\nresult followed an event in the only case known, therefore there was a\\ncausal connection. In a hearing before a committee of the Massachusetts\\nlegislature on a bill to establish closer relations between Boston and\\nits suburbs, the question was asked of a witness whether he believed\\nthat in the case of London \"the London police would have been as\\nefficient as they are now if there had been no annexation\" of the\\nsurrounding towns; he very properly replied: \"That\\'s a hard question to\\nanswer, because we have only the existing side to look at. We don\\'t know\\nwhat it would have been as separate communities.\" Wherever multiple\\ncauses are possible for a phenomenon it is unsafe to argue from a single\\ncase.\\n\\nAnother form of error in reasoning to a cause is to assume that a fact\\nis simple, when it is really complex, as in the following example:\\n\\nI do not think I am overstepping the bounds when I say that the headship\\nof no corporation, or state, or even the headship of the United States,\\nrequires greater general ability, force of character, or knowledge of\\nadministration than the head of administration of a great city like New\\nYork or Berlin. The latter we know to be well administered, the\\nformer--well, let us say, less so. The whole difference is in the\\nsystems. Apply the Berlin system to New York, and you will get Berlin\\nresults.\\n\\nHere the writer wholly ignores all sorts of active causes for this\\ndifference: Berlin has a tolerably homogeneous population, New York the\\nmost heterogeneous in the world; Germans by nature respect law and\\nauthority, and hanker for centralization; Americans make and break laws\\nlight-heartedly, and are restive under authority; and one might easily\\ngo further.\\n\\nArguments that national prosperity has followed a higher or a lower\\ntariff are especially apt to be vitiated by this error. It is not that\\nthe tariff has no relation to the prosperity, but that there are other\\ncauses intermingled with it which may have had more immediate effect. A\\nbad grain crop or a season of reckless speculation may obliterate all\\nthe traceable causes of a change in the tariff. Arguments from motive,\\ntoo, are apt to fall into this error. It is notorious that human motives\\nare mixed. If you argue that a whole class of business organizations are\\nevil because they have been formed solely for the purpose of making\\ninordinate and oppressive profits, you leave out of sight a motive which\\nis strong among American business men--the interest in seeing a great\\nbusiness more efficiently managed, and the desire to exercise power\\nbeneficently; and your argument suffers from its illegitimate assumption\\nof a simple cause. So in the same way if you are arguing for or against\\nthe advantages of the elective system in a school or a college, or of a\\nclassical education, or of athletics, it would be folly to assume that\\nany one cause or effect covered the whole case. Whenever in an argument\\nyou are trying to establish any such large and complex fact, you must be\\nwary lest you thus assume a single cause where in reality there are a\\nlegion of causes.\\n\\n41. Deductive Logic--the Syllogism. Deductive logic, as we have seen,\\ndeals with reasoning which passes from general principles to individual\\ncases. Its typical form is the syllogism, in which we pass from two\\npropositions which are given to a third, the conclusion. Of the two\\nformer one is a general principle, the other an assertion of a\\nparticular case. The classic example of the syllogism, which started\\nwith Aristotle and has grown hoary with repetition, and so venerable\\nthat it is one of the commonplaces of educated speech, runs as follows:\\n_All men are mortal, Socrates is a man, Therefore Socrates is mortal_.\\nHere there is the general principle, _All men are mortal_, and the\\nassertion about the particular case, _Socrates is a man_. The two have\\none term in common, _men_ (or more strictly, the class Man), which is\\nknown as the middle term, through which we reach the conclusion that the\\ncharacteristic of mortality in which all men are similar is true also of\\nSocrates, by virtue of his being a man. Of the other terms, _mortal_,\\nwhich is the more inclusive, is known as the major term, and _Socrates_,\\nthe less inclusive, as the minor term. The first two propositions are\\nthe premises, that which contains the major term being known as the\\nmajor premise, and the other as the minor premise.\\n\\nThe validity of the syllogism lies, as I have said, in the assertion of\\na general principle, and the bringing of the particular case in hand\\nunder that principle: if the principle is granted as incontrovertible,\\nand the special case as really coming under it, the conclusion is\\ninevitable.\\n\\nOn the syllogism in its various forms deductive logic has built up an\\nimposing structure of rules and conclusions. In practice the value of\\nthe syllogism is largely indirect. The trouble with it in itself as a\\nmode of progress in reasoning is twofold: in the first place there are\\nvery few general principles which, if you are cautious, you will accept\\nwithout reservations; and in the second place the crucial question in\\nanother set of cases is whether the given case really falls under the\\ngeneral principle. The syllogism, _All great statesmen are farsighted,\\nDaniel Webster was a great statesman, Therefore Daniel Webster was\\nfarsighted_, sounds simple; but two generations have disagreed on the\\nquestion whether Webster was a great statesman; and both _great\\nstatesman_ and _farsighted_ are such vague and inclusive terms that one\\nwould either accept a general principle of which they are terms as a\\nharmless truism, or else balk at being asked to grant a proposition\\nwhich might have unexpected meanings thrust into it. This double\\ndifficulty pursues the syllogism as a device for forwarding knowledge:\\neither it sets forth a truth so large and vague that you cannot say\\nwhether you accept it for all cases or not, or else the disagreement\\ncomes on one of the premises, and unless both the premises are granted,\\nstrictly syllogistic reasoning does not get under way.\\n\\nNevertheless, the syllogism has great practical value for the reasoning\\nand arguments of everyday life: in the first place it affords a means of\\nexpanding and scrutinizing the condensed forms of reasoning which are so\\ncommon and so useful; and in the second place it can be used to sum up\\nand state the results of a course of reasoning in incontrovertible form.\\nI shall examine and illustrate both these uses of the syllogism; but\\nfirst I shall give certain rules which govern all sound reasoning\\nthrough syllogisms. They were invented by Aristotle, the great Greek\\nphilosopher.\\n\\n42. The Rules of the Syllogism. (A term is said to be distributed,\\nor taken universally, when the proposition of which it is a part makes a\\nstatement about all the objects included in the term. In the proposition\\n_All men are mortal_, the term _men_ is obviously distributed, but\\n_mortals_ is not; for no assertion is made about all mortals but only\\nabout those that are included under all men. In the proposition _No hens\\nare intelligent_, both terms are distributed; for the assertion covers\\nall hens, and also the whole class of intelligent beings, since it is\\nasserted of the class as a whole that it contains no hens.)\\n\\nI. A syllogism must contain three terms, and not more than three\\nterms.\\n\\nThis rule is to be understood as guarding against ambiguity, especially\\nin the middle term; if the middle term, or either of the others, can be\\nunderstood in two ways, the syllogism will not hold water.\\n\\nII. A syllogism must consist of three and only three propositions.\\nThe reasons for this rule are sufficiently obvious.\\n\\nIII. The middle term of the syllogism must be distributed at least once\\nin the premises.\\n\\nIf it were not thus distributed or taken universally, the two premises\\nmight refer to separate parts of the middle term, and so there would be\\nno meeting ground on which to form the conclusion. In the syllogism,\\nAll good athletes lend a clean life, These men lead a clean life,\\nTherefore these men are good athletes, the fallacy lies in the fact\\nthat in neither premise is any assertion made about all men who lead a\\nclean life. This fallacy, which is not uncommon in practice where the\\nterms are complicated, is known as the fallacy of the undistributed\\nmiddle.\\n\\nIV. No term must be distributed in the conclusion unless it was\\ndistributed in at least one of the premises.\\n\\nIn other words, if you have premises which deal with part of a class\\nonly, you cannot reach a conclusion about the whole class. In the\\nsyllogism, All newspaper editors know how to write, All newspaper\\neditors are paid, Therefore all men who know how to write are paid, the\\nfallacy is obvious. But in the following, _All bitter partisans are\\ndangerous citizens, This man is not a bitter partisan, Therefore this\\nman is not a dangerous citizen_, one may have to scrutinize the\\nreasoning a little to see that the fallacy lies in the fact that\\n_dangerous citizen_ is taken universally in the conclusion, since a\\nproposition with a negative predicate makes an assertion about the whole\\nof its predicate, but that it is not taken universally in the premise in\\nwhich it occurs. A fallacy which thus arises from not noticing that a\\nnegative predicate distributes its term is apt to be insidious.\\n\\nV. No conclusion can be drawn from two negative premises.\\n\\nIn other words, if both the major term and the minor term lie outside\\nthe middle term, the syllogism gives us no means of knowing what their\\nrelation is to each other. The following example will make the reason\\nclear: _No amateur athlete has a salary for playing, John Gorman is not\\nan amateur athlete, Therefore John Gorman has a salary for playing_.\\n\\nVI. If one of the premises is negative, the conclusion must be\\nnegative.\\n\\nIf of the major and minor premise one is negative, then either the major\\nor the minor term does not agree with the middle term, and the other\\ndoes; therefore the major and minor term cannot agree with each other.\\n\\n43. The Syllogism in Practical Use. The practical value of the\\nsyllogism and its rules comes in the first place, as I have said, when\\nwe expand a condensed form of reasoning into its full grounds in the\\nform of a syllogism. Our reasoned judgments ordinarily take the\\nshortened form, _Socrates is mortal, because he is a man; The\\nCorporation Tax Bill is constitutional, because it is a tax on a way of\\ndoing business._ In each of these cases we are reasoning from a general\\nprinciple, which is previously established, and from a particular way of\\nconceiving the special fact before us, but we assume the general\\nprinciple as understood. In the cases above the meaning is clear without\\ndeclaring at length, _All men are mortal,_ or _All taxes on a way of\\ndoing business are constitutional._\\n\\nAt any time, however, when you find a piece of reasoning in this\\ncondensed form, whether your own or some one else\\'s, which seems to you\\nsuspicious, if you expand it into a full syllogism you will have all its\\nparts laid bare for scrutiny. Take, for example, the assertion,\\n_\"Robinson Crusoe\" must be a true story, for everything in it is so\\nminutely described_: if you expand it into the full syllogism, _All\\nbooks in which the description is minute are true, \"Robinson Crusoe\" is\\na book in which the description is minute, Therefore \"Robinson Crusoe\"\\nis true_, you would at once stick at the major premise. So where you\\nsuspect an ambiguity in the use of terms, you can bring it to the\\nsurface, if it is there, by the same sort of expansion. In the argument,\\n_Bachelors should be punished, because they break a law of nature_, the\\nambiguity becomes obvious when you expand: _All law breakers should be\\npunished, Bachelors break a law of nature, Therefore bachelors should be\\npunished_; at once you see that _law_ is used in two senses, one the\\n_law of the land_, the other the statement of a uniformity in nature. In\\nthe argument, _These men are good citizens, for they take an interest in\\npolitics_, the expansion to _All good citizens are interested in\\npolitics, These men are interested in politics, Therefore these men are\\ngood citizens,_[41] shows that the reasoning contains a breach of the\\nthird rule of the syllogism (see p. 148) and is therefore a case of the\\nfallacy of the undistributed middle.\\n\\nWhenever you make or find an assertion with a reason attached by such a\\nword as \"since,\" \"for,\" or \"because,\" or an assertion with a consequence\\nattached by a word like \"therefore,\" \"hence,\" or \"accordingly,\" you have\\na case of this condensed reasoning, which, theoretically at any rate,\\nyou can expand into a full syllogism, and so go over the reasoning link\\nby link.\\n\\nSometimes, however, the expansion is far from easy, for in many of the\\npractical exigencies of everyday life our judgments are intuitive, and\\nnot reasoned. In such judgments we jump to a conclusion by an\\ninarticulate, unreasoned feeling of what is true or expedient, and the\\ngrounds of the feeling may be so shadowy and complex that they can never\\nbe adequately displayed.\\n\\n\"Over immense departments of our thought we are still, all of us, in the\\nsavage state. Similarity operates in us, but abstraction\\nhas not taken place. We know what the present case is like, we know\\nwhat it reminds us of, we have an intuition of the right course to take,\\nif it be a practical matter. But analytic thought has made no tracks,\\nand we cannot justify ourselves to others. In ethical, psychological,\\nand aesthetic matters, to give a clear reason for one\\'s judgment is\\nuniversally recognized as a mark of rare genius. The helplessness of\\nuneducated people to account for their likes and dislikes is often\\nludicrous. Ask the first Irish girl why she likes this country better or\\nworse than her home, and see how much she can tell you. But if you ask\\nyour most educated friend why he prefers Titian to Paul Veronese, you\\nwill hardly get more of a reply; and you will probably get absolutely\\nnone if you inquire why Beethoven reminds him of Michael Angelo, or how\\nit comes that a bare figure with unduly flexed joints, by the latter,\\ncan so suggest the moral tragedy of life.... The well-known story of the\\nold judge advising the new one never to give reasons for his decisions,\\n\\'the decisions will probably be right, the reasons will surely be\\nwrong,\\' illustrates this. The doctor will feel that the patient is\\ndoomed, the dentist will have a premonition that the tooth will break,\\nthough neither can articulate a reason for his foreboding. The reason\\nlies embedded, but not yet laid bare, in all the previous cases dimly\\nsuggested by the actual one, all calling up the same conclusion, which\\nthe adept thus finds himself swept on to, he knows not how or why.\"[42]\\n\\nThe small boy who said that he could not keep step because he had a cold\\nin his head was relying on a sound general truth, _Colds in the head\\nmake one stupid_, for his major premise, but his condition prevented his\\ndisentangling it; and all of us every day use minor premises for which\\nwe should be incapable of stating the major.\\n\\nA second practical use of the syllogism is to set forth a chain of\\nreasoning in incontrovertible form. If you have a general principle\\nwhich is granted, and have established the fact that your case certainly\\nfalls under it, you can make an effective summing up by throwing the\\nreasoning into the form of a syllogism.\\n\\nConversely, you can use a syllogism to bring out some essential part of\\nthe reasoning of an opponent which you know will not commend itself to\\nthe audience, as did Lincoln in his debate with Douglas at Galesburg.\\nDouglas had defended the Dred Scott decision of the United States\\nSupreme Court, which decided that the right of property in a slave is\\naffirmed by the United States Constitution. Lincoln wished to make the\\nconsequences of this doctrine as glaringly evident as possible. He did\\nso as follows:\\n\\n    I think it follows, and I submit to the consideration of men capable\\n    of arguing, whether as I state it, in syllogistic form, the argument\\n    has any fault in it.\\n\\n    Nothing in the Constitution or laws of any State can destroy a right\\n    distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution of the United\\n    States.\\n\\n    The right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly\\n    affirmed in the Constitution of the United States.\\n\\n    Therefore, nothing in the Constitution or laws of any State can\\n    destroy the right of property in a slave.\\n\\n    I believe that no fault can be pointed out in that argument;\\n    assuming the truth of the premises, the conclusion, so far as I have\\n    capacity at all to understand it, follows inevitably.[43]\\n\\nLincoln knew that this doctrine that no state could interfere with\\nslavery would be intolerable to the people of Illinois, before whom he\\nwas carrying on his campaign; and this syllogism made clear to them the\\nconsequences of the decision of the Supreme Court.\\n\\nOr you can use a syllogism to make obvious a flaw in the reasoning of\\nyour opponent, as in the following example:\\n\\nIn view of the history of commission government in this country so far\\nas it has been made, the burden of proof rests with those who attempt to\\nshow that a government which has been so successful in cities of\\nmoderate size will not be successful in our largest cities. The\\nsyllogism they are required to prove runs briefly thus:\\n\\nCommission government is acknowledged to have been successful in cities\\nas large as one hundred and thirty thousand inhabitants, but\\n\\nIt has not been tried in cities containing more than one hundred and\\nthirty thousand inhabitants;\\n\\nTherefore, it will not be successful in cities of four hundred thousand\\nor larger, which is a _reductio ad absurdum_.\\n\\nThe folly of the attempt is shown by the very statement of the\\nconclusion.[44]\\n\\n44. The Dilemma. One special form of the syllogism is at times so\\nstrong an argument that it deserves special mention here, namely, the\\ndilemma. This is a syllogism in which the major premise consists of two\\nor more hypothetical propositions (that is, propositions with an \"if\"\\nclause) and the minor of a disjunctive proposition (a proposition with\\ntwo or more clauses connected by \"or\").\\n\\nIn the course of the Lincoln-Douglas debate a question was put by\\nLincoln to Douglas, as follows: \"Can the people of a United States\\nterritory in any lawful way, against the wish of any citizens of the\\nUnited States, exclude slavery from its limits, prior to the formation\\nof a state constitution?\" The question may be viewed as the source of a\\ndilemma, both in the practical and in the syllogistic sense of the term.\\nIn fact it involved a situation which, syllogistically, comprised more\\nthan one dilemma. They may be stated as follows:\\n\\nI. If Douglas answers yes, he offends the South, and if he answers no,\\nhe offends the North;\\n\\nBut he must answer either yes or no;\\n\\nTherefore he will offend either the South or the North.\\n\\nII. If Douglas offends the South, he loses the nomination for the\\nPresidency in the next convention; and if he offends the North, he loses\\nthe election to the United States Senatorship (and his chances for the\\nPresidency);\\n\\nBut he must offend either the South or the North;\\n\\nTherefore he loses either the Presidency or the Senatorship.\\n\\nOr, III. If Douglas offends the South, he cannot become President; and\\nif he offends the North, he cannot become President;\\n\\nBut he must offend either the South or the North;\\n\\nTherefore he cannot become President.[45]\\n\\nThe dilemma, if it leaves no hole for the other side to creep through,\\nis an extremely effective argument in politics and in competitive\\ndebate. If you can thus get your adversary between the devil and the\\ndeep sea on a point that in the eyes of your audience is interesting and\\ncritical, you have crippled his case. But if the point is not momentous,\\nthough your audience may find the dilemma amusing, you run the risk of\\nthe reproach of \"smartness\" if you crow very loudly over it.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a dilemma that is not exhaustive will hold no one.\\nMany of the arguments against the imposition of a federal tax on\\ncorporations assumed that if the tax were imposed it would soon be made\\nunreasonable in amount. Most arguments that the other side will abuse\\nany power that is given to them may be regarded as falling into the\\nclass of incomplete dilemma. A speaker who uses a leaky dilemma must\\nhave great confidence in the unintelligence of his audience, but it is\\nsurprising to see how often such dilemmas occur in political debates.\\n\\n45. Reasoning from Circumstantial Evidence. The third type of\\nreasoning from similarity named on page 120 is reasoning from\\ncircumstantial evidence. The term is familiar to every one from murder\\ntrials and detective stories. Webster\\'s argument in the White Murder\\nCase, from which I print a short extract on page 157, is a famous\\nexample of an argument on circumstantial evidence; and in fiction Sir\\nConan Doyle has created for our delectation many notable and ingenious\\ncases of it. But reasoning from circumstantial evidence is far from\\nbeing confined to criminal cases and fiction; as Huxley points out (see\\np. 241), it is also the basis of some of the broadest and most\\nilluminating generalizations of science; and the example below from\\nMacaulay is only one of innumerable cases of its use in history.\\n\\nReasoning from circumstantial evidence differs from reasoning from\\nanalogy or generalization in that it rests on similarities reaching out\\nin a number of separate directions, all of which, however, converge on\\nthe case in hand. This convergence is pointed out by Macaulay in the\\nfollowing admirable little argument on the authorship of the _Junius\\nLetters_, which were a series of pseudonymous and malignant attacks on\\nthe British government about 1770:\\n\\nWas he [Francis] the author of the Letters of Junius? Our own firm\\nbelief is that he was. The evidence is, we think, such as would support\\na verdict in a civil, nay, in a criminal proceeding. The handwriting of\\nJunius is the very peculiar handwriting of Francis, slightly disguised.\\nAs to the position, pursuits, and connections of Junius, the following\\nare the most important facts which can be considered as clearly proved:\\nfirst, that he was acquainted with the technical forms of the secretary\\nof state\\'s office; secondly, that he was intimately acquainted with the\\nbusiness of the war office; thirdly, that he, during the year 1770,\\nattended debates in the House of Lords, and look notes of speeches,\\nparticularly of the speeches of Lord Chatham; fourthly, that he bitterly\\nresented the appointment of Mr. Chamier to the place of deputy\\nsecretary-at-war; fifthly, that he was bound by some strong tie to the\\nfirst Lord Holland. Now, Francis passed some years in the secretary of\\nstate\\'s office. He was subsequently chief clerk of the war office. He\\nrepeatedly mentioned that he had himself, in 1770, heard speeches of\\nLord Chatham; and some of these speeches were actually printed from his\\nnotes. He resigned his clerkship at the war office from resentment at\\nthe appointment of Mr. Chamier. It was by Lord Holland that he was first\\nintroduced into the public service. Now, here are five marks all of\\nwhich ought to be found in Junius. They are all five found in Francis.\\nWe do not believe that more than two of them can be found in any other\\nperson whatever. If this agreement does not settle the question, there\\nis an end of all reasoning on circumstantial evidence.[46]\\n\\nHere the five points or marks of similarity between the writer of the\\nletters and Philip Francis are of such diversity that it would be an\\nextraordinary coincidence if there had happened to be two men whom they\\nwould fit: where so many lines converge so closely at a single point it\\nwould hardly be possible for them to meet on more than one person.\\n\\nThe following brief extract from Webster\\'s argument in the White Murder\\nCase shows the same sort of convergence of similarities: each\\ncircumstance in itself is hardly strong enough to furnish ground for an\\nargument on analogy, but taken all together they point irresistibly in\\none direction, namely, to the fact of a conspiracy.\\n\\nLet me ask your attention, then, in the first place, to those\\nappearances, on the morning after the murder, which have a tendency to\\nshow that it was done in pursuance of a preconcerted plan of operation.\\nWhat are they? A man was found murdered in his bed. No stranger had done\\nthe deed, no one unacquainted with the house had done it. It was\\napparent that somebody within had opened, and that somebody without had\\nentered. There had obviously and certainly been concert and cooperation.\\nThe inmates of the house were not alarmed when the murder was\\nperpetrated. The assassin had entered without any riot or any violence.\\nHe had found the way prepared before him. The house had been previously\\nopened. The window was unbarred from within, and its fastening\\nunscrewed. There was a lock on the door of the chamber in which Mr.\\nWhite slept, but the key was gone. It had been taken away and secreted.\\nThe footsteps of the murderer were visible, outdoors, tending toward the\\nwindow. The plank by which he entered the window still remained. The\\nroad he pursued had thus been prepared for him. The victim was slain,\\nand the murderer had escaped. Everything indicated that somebody within\\nhad cooperated with somebody without. Everything proclaimed that some of\\nthe inmates, or somebody having access to the house, had had a hand in\\nthe murder. On the face of the circumstances, it was apparent,\\ntherefore, that this was a premeditated, concerted murder; that there\\nhad been a conspiracy to commit it.[47]\\n\\nThe strength of reasoning from circumstantial evidence lies in the\\nnumber and the diversity of the points of similarity to the point in\\nhand. If there are few of them, the possibility of coincidence\\nincreases, as it also does when the points of similarity come from the\\nsame source or are of the same nature. This possibility of coincidence\\nis a good rough test of the value of reasoning from circumstantial\\nevidence: where the theory of a coincidence would stretch all\\nprobabilities one may safely leave it out of account.\\n\\nIn practice the argument from circumstantial evidence is more frequent\\nin the experience of lawyers than in that of other men; but sooner or\\nlater everybody has to pass on such reasoning, for wherever direct\\nevidence is out of the question it may be necessary to piece the\\nsituation together by circumstantial evidence. There is some prejudice\\nagainst such evidence, springing from reported cases of miscarriage of\\njustice in convictions based on it. Such cases, however, are very rare\\nin reality, and probably do not equal in number the cases in which\\nmistaken or false direct testimony has caused injustice.\\n\\n46. Some Pitfalls of Reasoning--Ambiguity. I have already spoken of\\nsome of the dangers to which reasoning is subject--false analogy, faulty\\ngeneralization of various kinds, and various sins against the rules of\\nthe syllogism. There are still a few general dangers to speak about. It\\nshould be noted that the various kinds of fallacies run into each other,\\nand not infrequently a given piece of bad reasoning can be described\\nunder more than one of them.\\n\\nOf all the sources of faulty and misleading reasoning, ambiguity is the\\nmost fruitful and the most inclusive.\\n\\nIt springs from the facts that words, except those which are almost\\ntechnically specific, are constantly used in more than one sense, and\\nthat a great many of the words which we use in everyday life are\\nessentially vague in meaning. Such common words as \"liberty,\" \"right,\"\\n\"gentleman,\" \"better,\" \"classic,\" \"honor,\" and innumerable others each\\nneed a treatise for any thorough definition; and then the definition, if\\ncomplete, would be largely a tabulation of perfectly proper senses in\\nwhich the words can be used, or a list of the ways in which different\\npeople have used them. Besides this notorious vagueness of many common\\nwords, a good many words, as I have already shown (p. 54), have two or\\nmore distinct and definable meanings.\\n\\nStrictly speaking, the ambiguity does not inhere in the word itself, but\\nrather in its use in an assertion, since ambiguity can arise only when\\nwe are making an assertion. It has been defined as \"the neglect of\\ndistinctions in the meaning of terms, when these distinctions are\\nimportant for the given occasion.\"[48] Suppose, for example, you are\\narguing against a certain improvement in a college dormitory, on the\\nground that it makes for luxury: clearly \"luxury\" is a word that may\\nmean one thing to you, and another to half of your audience. By itself\\nit is an indefinite word, except in its emotional implication; and its\\nmeaning varies with the people concerning whom it is used, since what\\nwould be luxury for a boy brought up on a farm would be bare comfort to\\nthe son of wealthy parents in the city. Indeed the advances of plumbing\\nin the last generation have completely changed the relative meanings of\\nthe words \"comfort\" and \"luxury\" so far as they concern bathrooms and\\nbathtubs. In the case of such a word, then, the weight of the definition\\nabove falls on the last clause, \"when these distinctions are important\\nfor the given occasion\"; here is a case where the occasion on which the\\nword \"luxury\" is used determines nearly the whole of its meaning. In\\npractice, if you have a suspicion that a word may be taken in another\\nsense than that you intend, the first thing to do is to define it--to\\nlay down as exactly as possible the cases which it is intended to cover\\non the present occasion, and the meaning it is to have in those cases.\\nFor good examples of this enlightened caution, see the definitions on\\npages 54-65, especially that from Bagchot.\\n\\nA similar difficulty arises with the words which, in the somewhat\\nslipshod use of everyday life, have come to have as it were a sliding\\nvalue.\\n\\nWe may raise no difficulty about understanding the assertions that\\nBrown, and Jones, and Robinson are \"honest,\" but when we come to the\\ncase of Smith we discover a difficulty in placing him clearly on either\\nside of the line. That difficulty is nothing less than the difficulty of\\nknowing the meaning given to the word in this particular assertion. We\\nmight, for instance, agree to mean by Smith\\'s \"honesty\" that no shady\\ntransactions could be legally proved against him, or that he is \"honest\\naccording to his lights,\" or again that he is about as honest as the\\nmajority of his neighbors or the average of his trade or profession.[49]\\n\\nThat this is not a fanciful case can be shown by noticing how often we\\nspeak of \"transparent\" honesty, or of \"absolute\" honesty: this is\\nnotably one of the words for which we have a sliding scale of values,\\nwhich vary considerably with the age and the community. \"Political\\nhonesty\" has a very different meaning in the England of to-day from that\\nwhich it had in the eighteenth century. To get at the exact meaning of\\nhonesty, then, either for Mr. Sidgwick\\'s Brown, Jones, Robinson, and\\nSmith, or for Mr. Asquith and Mr. Balfour as compared with Walpole or\\nPitt, we need a good deal more than a dictionary definition. What has\\nalready been said (p. 65) on the use of the history of the case to get a\\npreliminary understanding of the question which is to be argued, and the\\nterms to be used in it, applies all through the reasoning involved in\\nthe argument. Scrutinize all the terms you use yourself, as well as\\nthose used in arguments on the other side. I have already pointed out\\nthe ambiguity there is in the emotional implications of words; but the\\ndanger from it is so subtle and so besetting that it will be worth while\\nto dwell on it again. There are many cases in which there is no doubt as\\nto the denotation of the word,--the cases which it is intended to\\nname,--but in which the two sides to a controversy use the word with a\\ntotally different effect on their own and other people\\'s feelings.\\nBefore the Civil War pretty much the whole South had come to use the\\nword \"slavery\" as implying one of the settled institutions of the\\ncountry, more or less sanctified by divine ordinance; at the same time a\\nlarge portion of the North had come to look on it as an abomination to\\nthe Lord.\\n\\nHere there was no doubt as to the denotation of the word; but in a\\nhighly important respect it was ambiguous, because it implied a totally\\ndifferent reaction among the people who used it. In a case where the\\ncontrast is so glaring there is little danger of confusion; but there\\nare a good many cases where a word may have very different effects on\\nthe feelings of an audience without the fact coming very clearly to the\\nsurface. \"Liberal\" is to most Americans a term implying praise, so far\\nas it goes; to Cardinal Newman it implied what were to him the\\nirreverent and dangerous heresies of free thought, and therefore in his\\nmouth it was a word of condemnation.[50] \"Aesthetic\" to many good people\\nhas an implication of effeminacy and of trifling which is far from\\npraiseworthy; to artists and critics it may sum up what is most\\nadmirable in civilization. If in an argument on abolishing football as\\nan intercollegiate sport you describe a certain game as played \"with\\nspirit and fierceness,\" football players would think of it as a good\\ngame, but opponents of football would hold that such a description\\njustified them in classing the game with prize fighting. When one of the\\nterms you use may thus stir one part of your audience in one way, and\\nthe other part in just the opposite way, you are dealing with an\\nuncomfortable kind of ambiguity.\\n\\nIt is easy to get into the way of thinking that the denotation of a\\nword--the things which it names--is the only part of its meaning that\\ncounts; but with many words the connotation--I use the word in the\\nrhetorical rather than in the logical sense, to include its\\nimplications, associations, and general emotional coloring--has more\\neffect on human nature. There is a good deal of difference between\\ntelling a man that his assertion is \"incorrect,\" \"untrue,\" or \"false\";\\nif you use the last and he is at all choleric you may bring on an\\nexplosion. In argument, where you are aiming to persuade as well as to\\nconvince, the question of the feelings of your audience and how they\\nwill be affected by the terms you use is obviously of great importance.\\nAnd if you are using such terms as \"gentleman,\" \"political honesty,\"\\n\"socialist,\" \"coeducation,\" you must not forget that such words have a\\ndefinite emotional connotation, which will vary largely with the reader.\\n\\n47. Begging the Question. The fallacy of \"begging the question\"\\nconsists of assuming as true something that the other side would not\\nadmit. It is especially insidious in the condensed arguments of which I\\nspoke a few pages back. A common form of the fallacy consists of\\nslipping in an epithet which quietly takes for granted one\\'s own view of\\nthe question, or of using some expression that assumes one\\'s own view as\\ncorrect. For example, in an argument for a change in a city government,\\nto declare that all intelligent citizens favor it would be begging the\\nquestion. In an argument for the protection of crows, to begin, \"Few\\npeople know how many of these useful birds are killed each year,\" would\\nbe to beg the question, since the argument turns on whether crows are\\nuseful or not. A gross and uncivil form of this fallacy is to use\\nopprobrious epithets in describing persons who take the other view, as\\nin the following sentence from an article in a magazine on the question\\nof examinations for entrance to college:\\n\\nAs for interest and variety, what could destroy and taboo both more\\neffectually than the rigid and rigorous demands of a formal set of\\nexaminations prepared, as a rule, by pedantic specialists who know\\npractically nothing of the fundamental problems and needs of the high\\nschool.\\n\\nBegging the question is often committed in the course of defining terms,\\nas in the following passage from Cardinal Newman\\'s \"Idea of a\\nUniversity\":\\n\\n    It is the fashion just now, as you very well know, to erect\\n    so-called Universities, without making any provision in them at all\\n    for Theological chairs. Institutions of this kind exist both here\\n    [Ireland] and in England. Such a procedure, though defended by\\n    writers of the generation just passed with much plausible argument\\n    and not a little wit, seems to me an intellectual absurdity; and my\\n    reason For saying so runs, with whatever abruptness, into the form\\n    of a syllogism:--A University, I should lay down, by its very name\\n    professes to teach universal knowledge; Theology is surely a branch\\n    of knowledge; how then is it possible for it to profess all branches\\n    of knowledge, and yet to exclude from the subjects of its teaching\\n    one which, to say the least, is as important and as large as any of\\n    them? I do not see that either premise of this argument is open to\\n    exception.[51]\\n\\nThe obvious answer is that \"university\" is a vague term and that there\\nmay be many kinds of universities, as indeed there are in this country;\\nmoreover, the importance of theology is an arguable matter even among\\nchurch members.\\n\\nA well-recognized, but often subtle, form of begging the question is\\nwhat is known as \"arguing in a circle.\" Usually the fallacy is so\\nwrapped up in verbiage that it is hard to pick out. Here is a clear and\\nwell-put detection of a case of it:\\n\\nThere is an argument in favor of child labor so un-American and so\\ninhuman that I am almost ashamed to quote it, and yet it has been used,\\nand I fear it is secretly in the minds of some who would not openly\\nstand for it. A manufacturer standing near the furnace of a glasshouse\\nand pointing to a procession of young Slav boys who were carrying the\\nglass on trays, remarked, \"Look at their faces, and you will see that it\\nis idle to take them from the glasshouse in order to give them an\\neducation: they are what they are, and will always remain what they\\nare.\" He meant that there are some human beings--and these Slavs of the\\nnumber--who are mentally irredeemable, so fast asleep intellectually\\nthat they cannot be awakened; designed by nature, therefore, to be\\nhewers of wood and drawers of water. This cruel and wicked thing was\\nsaid of Slavs; it is the same thing which has been said from time\\nimmemorial by the slave owners of their slaves. First they degrade human\\nbeings by denying them the opportunity to develop their better nature:\\nno schools, no teaching, no freedom, no outlook; and then, as if in\\nmockery, they point to the degraded condition of their victims as a\\nreason why they should never be allowed to escape from it.[52]\\n\\nIn a diffuse and disorderly argument there is always a chance to find\\nsome begging of the question which may consist either of getting back to\\nan assumption of the original proposition and so arguing in a circle, or\\nof simply assuming that what has been asserted has been proved. The\\nfallacy of the invented example, in which a fictitious case is described\\nas an illustration, and presently assumed as a real case, is a not\\nuncommon form of begging the question.\\n\\n48. Ignoring the Question. This is a closely allied error in\\nreasoning that is apt to be due to the same kind of confused and woolly\\nthinking. It consists in slipping away from the question in debate and\\narguing vigorously at something else. A famous exposure of the fallacy\\nis Macaulay\\'s denunciation of the arguments in favor of Charles I:\\n\\nThe advocates of Charles, like the advocates of other malefactors\\nagainst whom overwhelming evidence is produced, generally decline all\\ncontroversy about the facts, and content themselves with calling\\ntestimony as to character. He had so many private virtues! And had James\\nthe Second no private virtues? Was Oliver Cromwell, his bitterest\\nenemies themselves being judges, destitute of private virtues? And what,\\nafter all, are the virtues ascribed to Charles? A religious zeal, not\\nmore sincere than that of his son, and fully as weak and narrow-minded,\\nand a few of the ordinary household decencies which half the tombstones\\nin England claim for those who lie beneath them. A good father! A good\\nhusband! Ample apologies indeed for fifteen years of persecution,\\ntyranny, and falsehood!\\n\\nWe charge him with having broken his coronation oath; and we are told\\nthat he kept his marriage vow! We accuse him of having given up his\\npeople to the merciless inflictions of the most hot-headed and\\nhard-hearted of prelates; and the defense is, that he took his little\\nson on his knee and kissed him! We censure him for having violated the\\narticles of the Petition of Right, after having, for good and valuable\\nconsideration, promised to observe them; and we are informed that he was\\naccustomed to hear prayers at six o\\'clock in the morning! It is to such\\nconsiderations as these, together with his Vandyke dress, his handsome\\nface, and his peaked beard, that he owes, we verily believe, most of his\\npopularity with the present generation.[53]\\n\\nIn an argument for woman suffrage on the ground that suffrage is a right\\nwhich ought not to be denied, it would be ignoring the question merely\\nto enumerate the various ways in which the responsibility of a vote\\nmight help to better the condition of women.\\n\\nTo ignore the question by trying to lead the public off on a false scent\\nis a constant device of officials who are accused of misconduct. A\\nUnited States senator whose election had been questioned gave in his\\ndefense a full and harrowing account of the struggles of his boyhood. A\\nboard of assessors who had been charged with incompetence ended their\\ndefense, in which they had taken no notice of the charges, as follows:\\n\\nCriticism of the Board of Assessors comes with poor grace from those\\nwhose endeavors for the common good are confined to academic essays on\\ngood government. It savors too much of the adroit pickpocket, who,\\nfinding himself hard pressed, joins in the chase, shouting as lustily as\\nany of the unthinking rabble, \"Stop, thief!\"\\n\\nThe curious thing is that this trick of crossing the scent does lead so\\nmany people off the trail.\\n\\nThe so-called _argumentum ad hominem_ and the _argumentum ad populum_\\nare special cases of ignoring the question: they consist of appeals to\\nthe feelings or special interests of the reader or the audience which\\nrun away from the question at issue. They are not uncommon in stump\\nspeeches, and in other arguments whose chief purpose is to arouse\\nenthusiasm.\\n\\nAn argument on the tariff, for example, sometimes runs off into appeals\\nto save this grand country from ruin or from the trusts or from some\\nother fate which the speaker pictures as hanging over an innocent and\\nplain people. An argument for the restoration of the classical system of\\neducation which should run off into eulogies of the good old times might\\neasily become an _argumentum ad populum_; an argument in favor of a new\\npark which should dwell on selfish advantages which might be gained by\\nthe abutters without regard to larger municipal policy would probably be\\nan _argumentum ad hominem_.\\n\\nObviously these two forms of shifting the issue trench closely on the\\nelement of persuasion in an argument, and in making the distinction you\\nmust apply common sense. Your adversary may reprove you for an\\n_argumentum ad hominem_ or _ad populum_, when you believe that you are\\nkeeping well within the bounds of legitimate persuasion; but in general\\nit is safe to guard your self-respect by drawing a broad line between\\ndodging and unworthy appeals to prejudice and justifiable appeals to\\nfeeling and personal interest.\\n\\n\\nEXERCISES\\n\\n1.

[Dispatch to a daily paper.] Haverhill, March 30, 1911. Opponents\\n    of commission form of government are deriving no little satisfaction\\n    from the development of testimony borne out by figures taken from\\n    the auditing department of the city of Haverhill that this method\\n    of administering municipal affairs has proved thus far to be a\\n    costly experiment there.... The total amount of bonds issued during\\n    the past twenty-seven months, covering the period of operation of\\n    commission form of government, was $576,000; the present borrowing\\n    capacity of the city is only approximately $35,000; that the city\\'s\\n    bonded debt has increased from $441,264 to $1,181,314 in the past\\n    five years; the net bonded debt has more than doubled within three\\n    years; that the assessed valuation has increased $5,000,000; and the\\n    tax rate has been raised from $17.40 to $19 in five years. The\\n    borrowing capacity of $341,696 on January 1, 1906, has decreased to\\n    $95,000 on January 1, 1911.... Commission form of government went\\n    into effect in Haverhill on the first Monday in January, 1909.\\n\\n    b. From an article in a magazine, opposing the plan of the\\n    postmaster-general to increase the postage on the advertising\\n    sections of magazines: consider especially the word \"censorship\":\\n\\n    We see two grave objections to the postmaster-general\\'s plan. First,\\n    it requires a censorship to determine what periodicals are\\n    \"magazines\" whose advertising pages are to be taxed, and what are\\n    the educational and religious periodicals which are to continue to\\n    enjoy what the President calls a \"subsidy.\" Such a censorship would\\n    be a new feature in postal administration, and it would seem to be a\\n    thing very difficult to work out on any fair basis.\\n\\n29. In a newspaper report of an inquiry made by the director of the\\nColumbia University gymnasium into the effects of smoking, the following\\nsentences occur:\\n\\n    In scholarship the nonsmokers had the distinct advantage. The\\n    smokers averaged eighty per cent in their studies at entrance,\\n    sixty-two per cent during the first two years, and seven per cent of\\n    failure. The nonsmokers got ninety-one per cent in their entrance\\n    examinations and sixty-nine per cent in their first two years in\\n    college, while only four per cent were failures. In this respect Dr.\\n    Meylan thinks there is a distinct relation between smoking and\\n    scholarship.\\n\\n    Of the same set of students forty-seven per cent of the smokers won\\n    places on varsity athletic teams, while only thirty-seven per cent\\n    of the nonsmokers could get places.\\n\\nIf the next to the last sentence had read, \"Smoking therefore seems to\\nbe a cause of low scholarship,\" what should you think of the reasoning?\\n\\n30. Criticize the reasoning in the following portion of an argument for\\nprohibition:\\n\\n    Dr. Williams says, \"We find no evidence that the prohibition laws\\n    have in the past been effective in diminishing the consumption of\\n    alcoholic beverages.\" ... The absence of logic in Dr. Williams\\'s\\n    conclusion will be readily seen by substituting the homicide evil\\n    and the greed evil for the liquor evil in his argument.\\n\\n    Since its establishment the United States has sought to remedy with\\n    prohibition the homicide evil. Every state has laws with severe\\n    penalties prohibiting murder. And yet the number of homicides in\\n    the United States has steadily increased until the number in 1910\\n    was eight thousand nine hundred and seventy-five. Since, then,\\n    homicides have steadily increased during the past hundred years\\n    under a law with severe penalties prohibiting them, a prohibitory\\n    law has not been and cannot be a remedy for homicide.\\n\\n31. Criticize the reasoning in the following extract from an argument\\nfor the electrification of the terminal part of a railroad:\\n\\n    It is true that locomotive smoke and gas do not kill people\\n    outright; but that their influence though not immediately measurable\\n    is to shorten life cannot, I submit, be successfully combated.... A\\n    few years ago I made some calculations based on the records of ten\\n    years\\' operation of the railroads in this state, and found that if a\\n    man should spend his whole time day and night riding in railroad\\n    trains at an average rate of thirty miles an hour, and if he had\\n    average good luck, he would not be killed by accident, without his\\n    fault, oftener than once in fifteen hundred years, and that he would\\n    not receive any injury of sufficient importance to be reported\\n    oftener than once in five hundred years. I ask you to estimate how\\n    long a man would, in your opinion, live if he were obliged\\n    continuously day and night to breathe the air of our stations\\n    without any opportunity to relieve his lungs by a breath of purer\\n    and better air.\\n\\n32.

Rational beings are accountable for their actions; brutes not\\n    being rational, are therefore exempt from responsibility. (From\\n    Jevons)\\n\\n36. Expand the following arguments into syllogisms and criticize their\\nsoundness:\\n\\n    a. The snow will turn to rain, because it is getting warmer.\\n\\n    b. The boy has done well in his examination, for he came out looking\\n    cheerful.\\n\\n    c. We had an economical government last year, therefore the tax rate\\n    will be reduced.\\n\\n    d. Lee will be a good mayor, for men who have energy and good\\n    judgment can do incalculable good to their fellow citizens.\\n\\n    e.

The candidate for stroke on the freshman crew came from Santos\\n    School, therefore he must be a good oarsman.\\n\\n37. Criticize the reasoning in the following arguments, pointing out\\nwhether they are sound or unsound, and why:\\n\\n    a. It costs a Nebraska farmer twenty cents to raise a bushel of\\n    corn. When corn gets down to twenty cents he cannot buy anything,\\n    and he cannot pay more than twelve or fifteen dollars a month for\\n    help. When it gets up to thirty-five cents the farmer gives his\\n    children the best education possible, and buys an automobile.\\n    Therefore the farmer will be ruined if the tariff on corn is not\\n    raised.\\n\\n    b. For many years the Democratic platforms have declared explicitly\\n    or implicitly against the duties on sugar; if the Democrats should\\n    come into power and reduce the duties, they would lose their\\n    strength in the states producing cane sugar and beet sugar; if they\\n    do not reduce the duty, they admit that their platforms have been\\n    insincere. (Condensed from an editorial in a newspaper. March, 1911)\\n\\n    c. I hardly need say that I am opposed to any such system as that of\\n    Galveston, or to call it by its broader name, the commission system.\\n    It is but another name for despotism. Louis XIV was a commissioner\\n    for executing the duties of governing France. Philip II was the same\\n    in Spain. The Decemvirs and Triumvirs of Rome were but the same sort\\n    of thing, as was also the Directory in France. They all came to the\\n    same end. Says Madison, in No. XLVII of _The Federalist_: \"The\\n    accumulation of all powers, legislative and judiciary, in the same\\n    hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary,\\n    self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very\\n    definition of tyranny.\" Mr. justice Story said, \"Whenever these\\n    departments are all vested in one person or body of men, the\\n    government is in fact a despotism, by whatever name it be called,\\n    whether a monarchy, an aristocracy, or a democracy.\"\\n\\n    d. The procedure of Berlin has in it an element of fairness worthy\\n    of our consideration; those representing large property interests\\n    have a surety of being at least represented. Some such system must\\n    be devised if the holding of properly at all be regarded as moral\\n    and necessary to our civilization. Remember that you are, in a large\\n    sense, but a chartered joint-stock corporation. Can you imagine the\\n    control of any other joint-stock corporation delivered over to those\\n    who have no stock or the least stock in it? Can you imagine the New\\n    York & New Haven Railroad, for example, controlled by the\\n    passengers, to the exclusion of the stock holders? Now this, to a\\n    very great degree, is what has happened in many of our cities. We\\n    have deprived the true stockholders, in some cases, of any\\n    representation whatever. I thus hold that to give property some\\n    voice in the control of a municipal corporation is but sense and\\n    justice.\\n\\n    e. We have tried commissions in Buffalo in branches of our city\\n    government. They have tried them in nearly every city in this\\n    country. We have governed our police by commissions, our parks by\\n    commissions, our public works by commissions. Commission government\\n    was for many years a fad in this country, and it has become\\n    discredited, so that of late we have been doing away with\\n    commissions and coming to single heads for departments having\\n    executive functions and some minor legislative functions, such as\\n    park boards, and police boards, and have been trying to concentrate\\n    responsibility in that way. In Erie County and throughout New York a\\n    commission elected by the people governs our counties. The board of\\n    supervisors is a commission government. It has never been\\n    creditable--always bad, even as compared with our city governments.\\n    To be sure, it is not just that kind of commission government. It is\\n    a larger commission; it is not elected at large, but by districts,\\n    but it is an attempt at the same thing. So I say there is nothing\\n    new about this idea of government by a commission.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nTHE ARGUMENT WRITTEN OUT\\n\\n\\n49. The Brief and the Argument. If your brief is thoroughly worked\\nout, and based on a careful canvass of the evidence, the work on your\\nargument ought to be at least two thirds over. The last third, however,\\nis not to be slighted, for on it will largely depend your practical\\nresults in moving your readers. Even a legal argument rarely goes to the\\ncourt on a written brief alone; and the average reader will never put\\nhimself to the effort of reading through and grasping such a brief as we\\nhave been planning here. Furthermore, if your complete argument is\\nmerely a copying out of the brief into consecutive sentences and\\nparagraphs, you will get few readers. The making of the brief merely\\ncompletes what may be called the architectural part of your labors; the\\nwriting of an argument will use all the skill you have in the choice of\\nwords and putting them together.\\n\\nWe saw in Chapter I that argument has two kinds of appeal to its reader:\\non the one hand, through its power of convincing it appeals to his\\nreason; on the other, through its persuasive power it appeals to his\\nfeelings and his moral and practical interests. Of these two kinds of\\nappeal the convincing power is largely determined by the thoroughness of\\nthe analysis and the efficiency of the arrangement, and therefore in\\nlarge part hangs on the work done in making the brief; the persuasive\\npower, on the other hand, though in part dependent on the line of\\nattack laid out in the brief and the choice of points to argue, is far\\nmore dependent on the filling in of the argument in the finished form.\\nEven the severest scientific argument, however, is much more than the\\nbare summary of the line of thought which would be found in a brief; and\\nin an argument like the speeches in most political campaigns a brief of\\nthe thought would leave out most of the argument. Wherever you have to\\nstir men up to do things you have only begun when you have convinced\\ntheir reason.\\n\\n50. The Introduction of the Argument. Much depends on the first\\npart of your argument, the introduction. Its length varies greatly, and\\nit may differ largely in other ways from the introduction to your brief.\\nIf the people you are trying to convince are familiar with the subject,\\nyou will need little introduction; a brief but clear statement of\\nfundamentals will serve the purpose. For such an audience it is chiefly\\nimportant to make the issues stand out, so that they shall see perfectly\\ndistinctly the exact points on which the question turns. Then the sooner\\nyou are at work on the business of convincing them, the better. In such\\narguments the introduction will perhaps not differ greatly in substance\\nfrom the introduction to the brief, though it must be reduced to\\nconsecutive and agreeable form. At the other extreme is such an argument\\nas that of Huxley\\'s (p. 233), where he had to prepare the way very\\ncarefully lest the prejudice against a revolutionary and unfamiliar view\\nof the animate world should close the minds of his hearers against him\\nbefore he was really started. Accordingly, before getting through with\\nhis introduction he expounded not only the three hypotheses between\\nwhich the choice must be made, but also the law of the uniformity of\\nnature and the principles and nature of circumstantial evidence. Where\\none shall stop between these two extremes is a question to be decided in\\nthe individual argument.\\n\\nOne thing, however, it is almost always wise to do; indeed, one would\\nnot go far wrong in prescribing it as a general rule: that is, to state\\nwith almost bald explicitness just how many main issues there are, and\\nwhat they are. In writing an argument it is always safe to assume that\\nmost of your readers will be careless readers. Few people have the gift\\nof reading closely and accurately, and of carrying what they have read\\nwith any distinctness. Therefore make it easy for your readers to pick\\nup and to carry your points. If you tell them that you are going to make\\nthree points or five, they are much more likely to remember those three\\nor five points than if they have to pick them out for themselves as they\\ngo along. Huxley, perhaps the ablest writer of scientific argument in\\nthe language, constantly practiced this device. In his great argument on\\nevolution, he says (see p. 235): \"So far as I know, there are only three\\nhypotheses which ever have been entertained, or which well can be\\nentertained, respecting the past history of nature\"; and then, as will\\nbe seen, he takes up each in turn, with the numbering \"first,\" \"second,\"\\nand \"third.\" In the same way in his essay \"The Physical Basis of Life\"\\nhe says, not far from the beginning, \"I propose to demonstrate to you\\nthat, notwithstanding these apparent difficulties, a threefold\\nunity--namely, a unity of power or faculty, a unity of form, and a unity\\nof substantial composition--does pervade the whole living world.\" Burke,\\nin his great speech \"On Conciliation with America,\" said, \"The capital\\nleading questions on which you must this day decide are two: first,\\nwhether you ought to concede; and secondly, what your concession ought\\nto be.\"\\n\\nIt is hardly too much to say that those writers whose sense of style is\\nmost developed are most likely to state the issues with the baldest and\\nmost direct precision.\\n\\nThe statement of the issues will bring out the importance of closely\\nlimiting the number of main issues. There are few subjects of argument\\nwhich do not conceivably touch the interests and beliefs of their\\naudiences in many directions; but out of these aspects some obviously\\ncount far more than others. If in your introduction you try to state all\\nthese issues, small and great, you will surely leave confusion behind\\nyou. Very few people are capable of carrying more than three or four\\nissues distinctly enough to affect their judgment of the whole case; and\\neven of these some will not take the trouble to do so. If you can simmer\\ndown the case to one or two or three critical points, you are making a\\ngood start toward winning over the minds of your readers.\\n\\nA good statement of the history of the case is apt to be a useful and\\nvaluable part of an introduction, especially for arguments dealing with\\npublic policies. If you remind readers of what the facts have been, you\\ncan more easily make clear to them the present situation from which you\\nmake your start. An argument for raising or lowering the tariff on some\\narticle would be apt to recount the history of the tariff so far as it\\nconcerned that article, and the progress in importing it and\\nmanufacturing it within the country. In writing out the argument from\\nthe brief on page 90 one would almost inevitably include the recent\\nhistory of the city government.\\n\\nIn general it is best to make this preliminary statement of the history\\nof the case scrupulously and explicitly impartial. An audience is likely\\nto resent any appearance of twisting the facts to suit the case; and if\\non their face they bear against your contentions, it is wiser to\\nprepare for your argument in some other way. There are more ways of\\nbeginning an argument than by a statement of facts; and resource in the\\npresentation of a case goes a long way toward winning it.\\n\\nIt is often wise to state your definitions with care, especially of\\nterms which are at the bottom of your whole case. The definition from\\nBagchot on page 58 is a good example. Here is the beginning of an\\naddress by President Eliot, in 1896, on \"A Wider Range of Electives in\\nCollege Admission Requirements\":\\n\\nAs usual, it is necessary to define the subject a little. \"A wider range\\nof electives in college admission requirements.\" What field are we\\nthinking of when we state this subject? If we mean the United States,\\nthe range of electives is already very large. Take, for example, the\\nrequirements for admission to the Leland Stanford University. Twenty\\nsubjects are named, of very different character and extent, and the\\ncandidate may present any ten out of the twenty. Botany counts just as\\nmuch as Latin. There is a wide range of options at admission to the\\nUniversity of Michigan, with its numerous courses leading to numerous\\ndegrees; that is, there is a wide range of subjects permissible to a\\ncandidate who is thinking of presenting himself for some one of its many\\ndegrees. If we look nearer home, we find in so conservative an\\ninstitution as Dartmouth College that there are three different degrees\\noffered, with three different assortments of admission requirements, and\\nthree different courses within the college. I noticed that at the last\\ncommencement there were forty-one degrees of the old-fashioned sort and\\ntwenty-seven degrees of the newer sorts given by Dartmouth College. Here\\nin Harvard we have had for many years a considerable range of electives\\nin the admission examinations, particularly in what we call the advanced\\nrequirements. We therefore need to limit our subject a little by saying\\nthat we are thinking of a wider range of admission electives in the\\nEastern and Middle State colleges, the range of electives farther west\\nbeing already large in many cases.[54]\\n\\nProfessor William James, in his essay \"The Will to Believe,\" in which he\\nargues that it is both right and unavoidable that our feelings shall\\ntake part in the making of our faiths, begins with a careful definition\\nand illustration of certain terms he is going to use constantly.\\n\\nNext, let us call the decision between two hypotheses an option. Options\\nmay be of several kinds. They may be (1) _living_ or _dead_; (2) _forced_\\nor _avoidable_; (3) _momentous_ or _trivial_; and for our purposes we\\nmay call an option a _genuine_ option when it is of the forced, living,\\nand momentous kind.\\n\\n1. A living option is one in which both hypotheses are live ones. If I\\nsay to you, \"Be a theosophist or be a Mohammedan,\" it is probably a dead\\noption, because for you neither hypothesis is likely to be alive. But if\\nI say, \"Be an agnostic or be a Christian,\" it is otherwise: trained as\\nyou are, each hypothesis makes some appeal, however small, to your\\nbelief.\\n\\n2. Next, if I say to you, \"Choose between going out with your umbrella\\nor without it,\" I do not offer you a genuine option, for it is not\\nforced. You can easily avoid it by not going out at all. Similarly, if I\\nsay: \"Either love me or hate me,\" \"Either call my theory true or call it\\nfalse,\" your option is avoidable. You may remain indifferent to me,\\nneither loving nor hating, and you may decline to offer any judgment as\\nto my theory. But if I say, \"Either accept this truth or go without it,\"\\nI put you on a forced option, for there is no standing place outside of\\nthe alternative. Every dilemma based on a complete logical disjunction,\\nwith no possibility of not choosing, is an option of this forced kind.\\n\\n3. Finally, if I were Dr. Nansen and proposed to you to join my North\\nPole expedition, your option would be momentous; for this would probably\\nbe your only similar opportunity, and your choice now would either\\nexclude you from the North Pole sort of immortality altogether or put at\\nleast the chance of it into your hands. He who refuses to embrace a\\nunique opportunity loses the prize as surely as if he tried and failed.\\n_Per contra_ the option is trivial when the opportunity is not unique,\\nwhen the stake is insignificant, or when the decision is reversible if\\nit later prove unwise. Such trivial options abound in the scientific\\nlife. A chemist finds an hypothesis live enough to spend a year in its\\nverification: he believes in it to that extent. But if his experiments\\nprove inconclusive either way, he is quit for his loss of time, no vital\\nharm being done.\\n\\nIt will facilitate our discussion if we keep all these distinctions well\\nin mind.[55]\\n\\nIn some arguments the working out of the definitions of a few principal\\nterms may occupy much space. Matthew Arnold, a famous critic of the last\\ngeneration, wrote as an introduction to a volume of selections from\\nWordsworth\\'s poems an essay with the thesis that Wordsworth is, after\\nShakespeare and Milton, the greatest poet who has written in English;\\nand to establish his point he laid down the definition that \"poetry is\\nat bottom a criticism of life; that the greatness of a poet lies in his\\npowerful and beautiful application of ideas to life--to the question,\\nHow to live.\" To the development of this definition he gave several\\npages, for the success of his main argument lay in inducing his readers\\nto accept it.\\n\\nMany legal arguments are wholly concerned with establishing definitions,\\nespecially in those cases which deal with statute law. The recent\\ndecisions of the Supreme Court of the United States in the Corporation\\nTax cases and the Standard Oil Case are examples: in each of these what\\nwas at issue was the exact meaning of the words used in certain statutes\\npassed by Congress. In the common law, too, there are many phrases which\\nhave come down from past centuries, the meanings of which have been\\ndefined again and again as new cases came up. We have seen (p. 63) how\\ncareful definition the word \"murder\" may need. \"Malice aforethought\" is\\nanother familiar instance: it sounds simple, but when one begins to fix\\nthe limits at which sudden anger passes over into cool and deliberate\\nenmity, or how far gone a man must be in drink before he loses the\\nconsciousness of his purposes, even a layman can see that it has\\ndifficulties.\\n\\nIn such cases as these a dictionary definition would be merely a\\nstarting point. It may be a very useful starting point, however, as in\\nthe following extract from an article by Mr. E.P. Ripley, president of\\nthe Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway Company, on \"The Railroads\\nand the People\":\\n\\nThere is one point regarding this matter that many forget: this is that\\nin all affairs there are two kinds of discrimination. There is the kind,\\nwhich, as the dictionary expresses it, \"sets apart as being different,\"\\nwhich \"distinguishes accurately,\" and there is the widely different kind\\nwhich \"treats unequally.\" in all ordinary affairs of life we condemn as\\n\"undiscriminating\" those who have so little judgment or fairness as not\\nto \"distinguish accurately\" or \"set apart things that are\\ndifferent\"--who either treat equally things that are unequal, or treat\\nunequally things that are equal. Now, when the railway traffic manager\\n\"sets apart things that are different,\" and treats them differently, he\\nsimply does what it is the duty of every one to do.[56]\\n\\nThen he goes on to develop this definition by showing the facts on which\\nit has to bear.\\n\\nOn the other hand do not bore your readers with dictionary definitions\\nof words whose meaning no one doubts; that is a waste of good paper for\\nyou, and of good time for them; and we have seen in Chapter II the\\nfutility of the dictionary for cases in which there is real disagreement\\nover the meaning of a word.\\n\\nIt will be seen, then, that the analysis you have made in preparation\\nfor the brief may spread out large or small in the argument itself. It\\nis wise, therefore, to look on the work done for the introduction to the\\nbrief as work done largely to clear up your own thought on the subject;\\nwhen you come to writing out the argument itself, you can go back to the\\nintroduction to the brief, and see how much space you are now going to\\ngive it.\\n\\nIn a college or school argument you will usually follow it rather\\nclosely; and you do well to do so, for you will thus fix in your mind a\\nuseful model. But when you get out into the world, you will have to\\nconsider in each case the needs and prepossessions of the particular\\naudience. Here as everywhere in the argument you must exercise judgment;\\nthere is no formula which will fit all cases. The scheme of analysis of\\nthe case which has been expounded in Chapter II has stood the test as\\nthe best means yet found of exploring a subject and insuring clarity of\\nthought and certainty of attack;[57] but I know of no single fixed scheme\\nfor the argument itself which will not be racked apart by the first half\\ndozen practical arguments you apply it to.\\n\\n51. The Body of the Argument. In the main body of the argument the\\ndifference from the brief will be largely a matter of expansion: the\\nbrief indicates the evidence, the argument states it at length. Here\\nagain you cut your argument to fit your audience and the space at your\\ncommand. In an argument in the editorial of a newspaper, which is rarely\\nlonger than a long college theme, there is little space for the\\nstatement of evidence. In Webster\\'s argument in the White Murder Case,\\nwhich has some thirteen thousand words and which must have taken two\\nhours or more to deliver, the facts are studied in minute detail. Most\\npeople are surprised to see the way in which a full statement of\\nevidence eats up space; if the facts are at all complicated, they must\\nbe analyzed and expounded one by one and their bearing on the case laid\\nout in full. This necessity of using space in order to make facts clear\\nis the reason why it is so hard to find adequate and convincing\\narguments which will print in less than fifteen or twenty pages. The\\ntrouble with a swift and compact argument like that of Macaulay\\'s on the\\nauthorship of the _Junius Letters_ (see p. 155) is that unless you have\\ngone into the question for yourself, you do not know whether to accept\\nthe stated facts or not. If you do accept them, the conclusion is\\ninevitable; but if you happen to know that scholars have long held the\\ndecision doubtful, you want to know more about the facts in detail\\nbefore surrendering to Macaulay\\'s conclusion. For an average reader\\nto-day, who knows little of the facts, this argument would have to be\\ngreatly expanded.\\n\\nIn this expansion comes the chance for all the skill in exposition that\\nyou can muster, and for that subtle appeal to your readers\\' feelings\\nwhich lies in vividness and precision of phrasing, considerations with\\nwhich I will deal separately further on. Questions of proportion of\\nspace we may consider here.\\n\\nThe only rule that can be laid down for the distribution of your space\\nis to use your sagacity, and all your knowledge of your subject and of\\nyour audience. In a written argument you have the advantage that you can\\nlet your pen run on your first draft, and then go back and weigh the\\ncomparative force of the different parts of the argument, and cut out\\nand cut down until your best points for the purpose have the most space.\\nIn a debate the same end is gained by rehearsals of the main speeches;\\nin the rebuttal, which is best when it is spontaneous, you have to trust\\nto the judgment gained by practice.\\n\\nOther things being equal, however, brevity carries an audience. If you\\ncan sum up your case in half the time that it takes the other side to\\nstate theirs, the chances are that your audience will think you have the\\nright of it. Above all, beware of boring your readers by too exhaustive\\nexplanation of details or of aspects of the case which they care nothing\\nabout. I suppose there is no one of us who has not a worthy friend or\\ntwo who will talk through a whole evening on whether a lawn should be\\nwatered in the evening or the early morning, or whether the eighth hole\\non the golf course should not be fifty yards longer. One must not be\\nlike the man who in the discussion of bimetallism a few years ago used\\nto keep his wife awake at night expounding to her the iniquities and\\ninequalities of a single standard. It is safer to underestimate than to\\noverestimate the endurance and patience of your audience.\\n\\n52. The Refutation. The place of the refutation will, as we have\\nseen in the chapter on planning (see p. 82), vary greatly with the\\nargument and with the audience. Its purpose is to put out of the way as\\neffectively as possible the main points urged by the other side. In an\\nargument of fact this is done both by exposing weak places in the\\nreasoning and by throwing doubt on the facts cited, either through proof\\nthat they are contradicted by better evidence, or that the evidence\\nbrought forward to establish them is shaky or inconclusive. In an\\nargument of policy the points on the other side are met either by\\nthrowing doubt on the facts on which they rest, or by showing that the\\npoints themselves have not coercive force.\\n\\nWhere there are really strong points on the other side, in either kind\\nof argument, it is often sound policy to admit their strength. This is\\nespecially true in arguments of policy where the advantages are closely\\nbalanced. If you are trying to convince a boy that he should go to your\\ncollege rather than to another, you do not gain anything by telling him\\nthat the other college is no good; if he is worth gaining over he will\\nknow better than that. And in general if you have given a man to\\nunderstand that there is nothing to be said for the other side, and he\\nafterwards finds that there are strong grounds for it, your argument\\nwill have a fall in his estimation.\\n\\nIn the manner of your refutation lean towards the side of soberness and\\ncourtesy. It has been said that the poorest use you can put a man to is\\nto refute him; and it is certain that in the give and take of argument\\nin active life the personal victories and defeats are what are soonest\\nforgotten. If after a while you have to establish a fact in history or\\nin biology, or to get a verdict from a jury or a favorable report from\\nthe committee of a legislature, you will think a good deal more about\\nthe arguments of your opponents than about them personally. There are\\nfew arguments in which you can afford to take no notice of the strong\\npoints of the other side; and where the burden of proof is strongly with\\nyou, your own argument may be almost wholly refutation; but it is\\nalways worth bearing in mind that if it is worth while for you to be\\narguing at all, there is something, and something of serious weight, to\\nbe said on the other side.\\n\\n53. The Conclusion. The conclusion of your argument should be short\\nand pointed. Gather the main issues together, and restate them in terms\\nthat will be easy to remember. Mere repetition of the points as you made\\nthem in your introduction may sound too much like lack of resource; on\\nthe other hand, it helps to make your points familiar, and to drive them\\nhome. In any event make your contentions easy to remember. Most of us go\\na long way towards settling our own minds on a puzzling question when we\\nrepeat to some one else arguments that we have read or heard. If you can\\nso sum up your argument that your readers will go off and unconsciously\\nretail your points to their neighbors, you probably have them. On the\\nother hand, when you have finished your argument, if you start in to\\nhedge and modify and go back to points that have not had enough emphasis\\nbefore, you throw away all you have gained. In arguing nothing succeeds\\nlike decision and certainty of utterance. Even dogmatism is better than\\nan appearance of wabbling. It is the men like Macaulay, who see\\neverything black and white with no shades between, who are the leaders\\nof the world\\'s opinion. Sum up, then, wherever it is decent to do so, as\\nif there were only one side of the case, and that could be stated in\\nthree lines.\\n\\n54. The Power of Convincing. The convincing power of an argument\\ndepends on its appeal to the reason of its readers. To put the same fact\\nin another way, an argument has convincing power when it can fit the\\nfacts which it deals with smoothly and intelligently into the rest of\\nthe reader\\'s experience. If an argument on a complicated mass of facts,\\nsuch as the evidence in a long murder case, makes the reader say, \"Yes,\\nnow I see how it all happened,\" or an argument for the direct election\\nof United States senators makes him say, \"Yes, that is a plain working\\nout of the fundamental principles of popular government,\" then he is\\nconvinced. In this aspect argument merges into exposition. It is\\nsignificant that, as has already been noted, Matthew Arnold\\'s argument\\nthat Wordsworth is the greatest English poet after Shakespeare and\\nMilton, and Huxley\\'s argument that the physical basis of animal and\\nplant life is the same, are both used in a book of examples of\\nexposition.[58] The essential difference between argument and exposition\\nfrom this point of view lies in the emphasis: normally an explanation\\ncovers the whole case evenly; an argument throws certain parts and\\naspects of the case into relief.\\n\\nIf, therefore, to be convincing, your argument must provide a reasonable\\nexplanation of the whole state of affairs to which the case belongs, you\\ncan use all the devices there are for clear and effective explanation. I\\nwill therefore briefly review a few of these.\\n\\nOf the value of an introduction which lays out the ground to be covered\\nI have already spoken. The more distinct an idea you can implant in your\\nreaders\\' minds of the course you are going to follow in your argument,\\nthe more likely they will be to follow it. Since the success of your\\nargument hangs on carrying them with you on the main issues, let them\\nknow beforehand just what those issues are, and in such a way that they\\ncan hold them with a minimum of effort. The value of a clear and, as it\\nwere, maplike introduction is even greater in an argument than in an\\nexposition.\\n\\nIn the second place, use your paragraphing for all that it is worth, and\\nthat is a great deal. The success of any explanation or argument springs\\nfrom the way in which it takes a mass of facts apart, and rearranges\\nthem simply and perspicuously; and there is no device of composition\\nwhich helps so much towards clearness as good paragraphing. Accordingly\\nwhen you come to make your final draft, make certain that each paragraph\\nhas unity. If you have any doubts see if you can sum up the paragraph\\ninto a single simple sentence. Then look at the beginnings of the\\nparagraphs to see whether you have made it easy for your readers to know\\nwhat each one is about. Macaulay\\'s style is on the whole clearer and\\nmore effective for a general audience than that of any other writer in\\nEnglish; and his habit of beginning each paragraph with a very definite\\nannouncement of its subject is almost a mannerism. Incidentally there is\\nno better rough test of the unity of your paragraphs than thus to give\\nthem something of the nature of a title in the first sentence. Often,\\ntoo, at the end of an important paragraph it is worth while to sum up\\nits essence in pithy form. Mankind in general is lazy about thinking,\\nand more than ready to accept an argument which is easy to remember and\\nrepeat. The end of a paragraph is the place for a catchword.\\n\\nIn the third place, bind the sentences in your paragraphs together. When\\none is building up a first draft, and picking facts from a variety of\\nsources, it is inevitable that the result shall be somewhat disjointed.\\nIn working over the first draft, really work it over, and work it\\ntogether. Make all the sentences point the same way. Pronouns are the\\nmost effective connectives that we have; therefore recast your\\nsentences so that there will be as little change of subject as possible.\\nThen use the explicit connectives in as much variety as you can. It is\\nnot likely that you will make your paragraphs too closely knit for the\\naverage reader.\\n\\nIn the fourth place, bind your argument together as a whole by\\nconnectives at the beginnings of the paragraphs and by brief summarizing\\nparagraphs. In the present generation of schoolboys a good many have\\ngroaned over Burke\\'s speech \"On Conciliation with America\"; but if the\\nfirst time that one of these sufferers must make an argument in real\\nearnest, he will go back to Burke for some of the devices used to bind\\nthat argument together, he will be surprised to see how practically e\\nefficient those devices are. And none of them counts more for clarity\\nand thoroughness than the conscientious way in which Burke took his\\nhearers by the hand at the beginning of each paragraph, and at each turn\\nin his argument, to make sure that they knew just how they were passing\\nfrom one point to another.\\n\\nFrom the doctrine of clear explanation, then, we may carry over to the\\nmaking of clear arguments the habit of laying out the ground at the\\nbeginning, of making the paragraphs do their full work by attending to\\nunity, to emphasis, and to coherence, and of binding the paragraphs\\ntogether into a closely knit whole.\\n\\n55. The Power of Persuading. Finally, we have to consider the\\nquestion of how an argument can be made persuasive--probably the most\\ndifficult subject in the range of rhetoric on which to give practical\\nadvice. The key to the whole matter lies in remembering that we are here\\ndealing with feelings, and that feelings are irrational and are the\\nproduct of personal experience. The experience may be bitter or sweet,\\nand to some degree its effects are modified by education; but in\\nsubstance your feelings and emotions make you what you are, and your\\ncapacities in these directions were born with you. If the citizens of a\\ntown have no feeling about political dishonesty, reformers may talk\\ntheir throats out without producing any result; it is only when taxes\\nget intolerable or the sewers smell to heaven that anything will be\\ndone. Many people die for whose deaths each of us ought to feel grief,\\nbut if these people have never happened to touch our feelings, we can\\nreason with ourselves in vain that we should feel deeply grieved.\\nFeeling and emotion are the deepest, most primitive part of human\\nnature; and very little of its field has been reduced to the\\ngeneralizations of reason.[59]\\n\\nWhen you come, therefore, in the making of your argument to the point of\\nstirring up the feelings of your readers on the subject, do not waste\\nany time in considering what they ought to feel: the only pertinent\\nquestion is what they do feel. On your shrewdness in estimating what\\nthese feelings are, and how strong they are, will hang your success as\\nan advocate. Tact is the faculty you need now--the faculty of judging\\nmen, of knowing when they will rise to an appeal, and when they will lie\\nback inert and uninterested. This is a matter you cannot reason about;\\nif you have the faculty it will be borne in on you how other men will\\nfeel on your subject. The skill of politicians, where it does not\\nconfine itself to estimating how much the people will stand before\\nrebelling, consists in this intuition of the movement of public opinion;\\nand the great leaders are the men who have so sure a sense of these\\nlarge waves of popular feeling that they can utter at the right moment\\nthe word that will gather together this diffused and uncrystallized\\nfeeling into a living force. Lincoln\\'s declaration, \"A house divided\\nagainst itself cannot stand, I believe that this government cannot\\nendure permanently half slave and half free,\" brought to a head a\\nconflict that had been smoldering ever since the adoption of the\\nConstitution, and made him the inevitable leader who was to bring it to\\na close. It will be noticed, however, that the time had to come before\\nthe inspired word could make its appeal. The abolitionists and\\nantislavery men had long been preaching the same doctrine that Lincoln\\nuttered, and the folly and wickedness of slavery had been proved by\\nphilosophers and preachers for generations. Until the time grows ripe\\nthe most reasonable doctrine does not touch the hearts of men; when the\\ntime has ripened, the leader knows it and speaks the word that sets the\\nworld on fire for righteousness.\\n\\nThe same faculty, on a smaller scale, is needed by every one of us who\\nis trying to make other people do anything. The actual use of the\\nfaculty will vary greatly, however, with different kinds of arguments.\\nIn certain kinds of scientific argument any attempt at persuasion as\\nsuch would be an impertinence: whether heat is a mode of motion, whether\\nthere are such infinitesimal bodies as the ions which physicists of\\nto-day assume to explain certain new phenomena, whether matter consists\\nof infinitesimal whirls of force--in all such questions an argument\\nappeals solely to the reason; and in such Bacon\\'s favorite apophthegm\\nhas full sway, Dry light is ever the best. In Huxley\\'s arguments for the\\ntheory of evolution feeling had some share, for when the theory was\\nfirst announced by Darwin some religious people thought that it cut at\\nthe foundations of their faith, and Huxley had to show that loyalty to\\ntruth is a feeling of equal sanctity to scientific men: hence there is\\nsome tinge of feeling, though repressed, in his argument, and a definite\\nconsciousness of the feelings of his audience.\\n\\nAt the other extreme are the arguments where the appeal to feelings is\\neverything, since it is clear that the audience is already of the\\nspeaker\\'s way of thinking. Examples of such arguments are most apt to be\\nfound in speeches in political campaigns and in appeals for money to\\nhelp forward charities of all kinds. It is probable that most of the\\nconversions in political matters are through reading; consequently the\\npurpose of the speeches is to stir up excitement and feeling to such a\\nheat that the maximum of the party voters will take the trouble to go\\nout to the polls. Arguments directed to this class, accordingly, are\\nalmost wholly appeals to feeling. The famous debate between Lincoln and\\nDouglas in 1858 was of this character; of the thousands of people who\\nheard them in one or another of the seven debates most had taken sides\\nalready. In such a case as this, however, where a change in general\\npolitical opinion was impending, the reasoning of the debates had more\\nforce than in ordinary times, and probably helped many voters to a\\nclearer view of a very distressing and harassing situation. Between\\ntimes, however, in politics, where there are no great moral or practical\\ndifferences between parties, the purpose of speeches is almost wholly\\npersuasive. Success one way or another is a question of getting out the\\nvoters who more or less passively and as a matter of habit hold to the\\nparty. Party speakers, accordingly, use every device to wake up their\\nvoters, and to make them believe that there is a real crisis at hand.\\nEvery attempt is made to attach moral issues to the party platforms, and\\nto show how the material prosperity of the voters will fail if the\\nother party wins.\\n\\nRoughly, therefore, we may say that persuasion tends to play a small\\npart in arguments of facts, and a larger part in questions of policy.\\nThis is a rough generalization only, for every one knows what eloquence\\nand efforts at eloquence go into the arguments before juries in capital\\ncases, and how dry and abstract are the arguments before the judges on\\npoints of law, or on questions of public policy in books of political\\neconomy. But in the long run, the less feeling enters into decisions of\\nquestions of fact, the better.\\n\\nOf the factors which make for the persuasiveness of an argument I will\\nspeak here of three--clearness of statement, appeal to the practical\\ninterests of the audience, and direct appeal to their feelings.\\n\\nThere can be no doubt that clearness of statement is a powerful element\\nin making an argument persuasive, though the appeal that it makes to the\\nfeelings of the readers is slight and subtle. In practice we mostly read\\narguments either to help make up our minds on a subject or to get aid in\\ndefending views for which we have no ready support. In the latter case\\nwe do not need to be persuaded; but in the former there can be no\\nquestion that an argument which clears up the subject, and makes it\\nintelligible where before it was confusing, does have an effect on us\\nover and above its aid to our thought.\\n\\n56. The Practical Interests of the Audience. Of directly persuasive\\npower, however, are the other two factors--the appeal to the practical\\ninterests of readers, and the appeal to their emotions. Of these the\\nappeal to practical interests has no proper place in arguments on\\nquestions of fact, but a large and entirely proper share in most\\narguments of policy. Henry Ward Beecher\\'s speech on the slavery issue in\\nthe Civil War, before the cotton operatives of Liverpool,[60] is a\\nclassic example of the direct appeal to the practical interests of an\\naudience. They were bitterly hostile to the North, because the supplies\\nof cotton had been cut off by the blockade; and after he had got a\\nhearing from them by appealing to the English sense of fair play, he\\ndrove home the doctrine that a slave population made few customers for\\nthe products of English mills. Then he passed on to the moral side of\\nthe question.\\n\\nArguments on almost all public questions--direct election of senators,\\ndirect primaries, commission form of government, tariff, currency,\\ncontrol of corporations, or, in local matters, the size of a school\\ncommittee, the granting of franchises to street railroads or water\\ncompanies, the laying out of streets, the rules governing parks--are all\\nquestions of policy in which the greatest practical advantage to the\\ngreatest proportion of those who are interested is the controlling force\\nin the decision. At particular times and places moral questions may\\nenter into some of these questions, but ordinarily we come to them to\\nsettle questions of practical advantage.\\n\\nIn arguments on all such questions, therefore, the direct appeal to the\\npractical interests of the people you are addressing is the chief factor\\nthat makes for persuasiveness. Will a change to a commission form of\\ngovernment make towards a reduction of taxes and towards giving greater\\nand more equitably distributed returns for those that are levied? Will\\nthe direct primary for state officers make it easier and surer for the\\naverage citizen of the state to elect to office the kind of men he wants\\nto have in office? Will a central bank of issue, or some institution\\nlike it, establish the business of the country on a basis less likely to\\nbe disturbed by panics? Will a competing street-car line make for better\\nand cheaper transportation in the city? In all such questions the only\\ngrounds for decision are practical, and founded in the prosperity and\\nthe convenience of the people who have the decision.\\n\\nTo make arguments in such cases persuasive you must show how the\\nquestion affects the practical interests of your readers, and then that\\nthe plan which you support will bring them the greatest advantage.\\nGeneralities and large political truths may help you to convince them;\\nbut to persuade them to active interest and action you must get down to\\nthe realities which touch them personally. If you are arguing for a\\ncommission government in your city on the ground of economy, show in\\ndollars and cents what portion of his income the owner of a house and\\nlot worth five or ten thousand dollars pays each year because of the\\npresent extravagance and wastefulness. If you can make a voter see that\\nthe change is likely to save him ten or twenty-five or a hundred dollars\\na year, you have made an argument that is persuasive. The arguments for\\nthe reformation of our currency system are aimed directly at the\\nmaterial interests of the business men of the country and their\\nemployees; and the pleas for one or another system attempt to show how\\neach will conduce to the greater security and profit of the greatest\\nnumber of people.\\n\\nTo make such arguments count, however, you must deal in concrete terms.\\nA recent argument[61] for the establishment of a general parcels post in\\nthis country presents figures to show that for the transportation of a\\nparcel by express at a rate of forty-five cents, the railroad gets\\ntwenty-two and one-half cents for service which it could do at a\\nhandsome profit for five cents. Of the validity of these figures I have\\nno means of judging; but the effectiveness of the argument lies in its\\nmaking plain to each of its readers a fact which touches his pocket\\nevery time he sends a parcel by express. It is this kind of argument\\nthat has persuasiveness, for the way we spend our money and what we get\\nfor it come close home to most of us. Of all practical interests those\\nof the purse are of necessity the most moving for all but the very rich.\\n\\nMoney interests, however, are far from being the only practical\\ninterests which concern us: there are many matters of convenience and\\ncomfort where an individual or a community is not thinking of the cost.\\nSuch questions as what kind of furnace to set up, whether to build a\\nhouse of brick or of cement, which railroad to take between, two cities,\\nare questions that draw arguments from other people than advertising\\nagents. Of another sort are questions that concern education. What\\ncollege shall a boy go to; shall he be prepared in a public school, or a\\nprivate day school, or a boarding school? Shall a given college admit on\\ncertificate, or demand an examination of its own? Shall a certain public\\nschool drop Greek from its list of studies; shall it set up a course in\\nmanual training? All these are examples of another set of questions that\\ntouch practical interests very closely. In arguments on such questions,\\ntherefore, if you are to have the power of persuading and so of\\ninfluencing action, you must get home to the interests of the people you\\nare trying to move. The question of schools is very different for a boy\\nin a small country village and for one in New York City; the question\\nof admission is different for a state university and for an endowed\\ncollege; the question of Greek is different for a school which sends few\\npupils on to college and for one which sends many: and in each case if\\nyou want to influence action, you must set forth facts which bear on the\\nproblem as it faces that particular audience. Except perhaps for the\\nhighest eloquence, there is no such thing as universal persuasiveness.\\nThe questions which actively affect the average man usually concern\\nsmall groups of people, and each group must be stirred to action by\\nincentives adapted to its special interests.\\n\\n57. The Appeal to Moral Interests. Still further from the interests\\nthat touch the pocket, and constantly in healthy and elevating action\\nagainst them, are the moral interests. The appeal to moral motives is\\nsometimes laughed at by men who call themselves practical, but in\\nAmerica it is in the long run the strongest appeal that can be made. We\\nare still near enough to the men who fought through the Civil War, in\\nwhich each, side held passionately to what it believed to be the moral\\nright, for us to believe without too much complacency that moral forces\\nare the forces that rule us as a nation. Mr. Bryan and Mr. Roosevelt\\nhave both been called preachers, and the hold they have had on great,\\nthough differing, parts of the American people is incontestable. If any\\nquestion on which you have to argue has a moral side, it is not only\\nyour duty, but it is also the path of expediency, to make appeal through\\nthe moral principle involved.\\n\\nThe chief difficulty with making an appeal to moral principles is to set\\nthem forth in other than abstract terms, since they are the product of a\\nset of feelings which lie too deep for easy phrasing in definite words.\\nIn most cases we know what is right long before we can explain why it is\\nright; and a man who can put into clear words the moral forces that move\\nhis fellows is a prophet and leader of men. Moreover, it must be\\nremembered when one is appealing to moral principles that upright men\\nare not agreed about all of them, and there is even more doubt and\\ndisagreement when one comes to the practical application of the\\nprinciples. We have seen in Chapter I what bitter division arose in our\\nfathers\\' time over the right and the righteousness of slavery; and how\\nin many states to-day good and God-fearing people are divided on the\\nquestion of prohibition.\\n\\nBut even where the two sides to a question agree on the moral principle\\nwhich is involved, it by no means follows that they will agree on its\\napplication in a particular case. Church members accept the principle\\nthat one must forgive sinners and help them to reform; but it is another\\nthing when it comes to getting work for a man who has been in prison, or\\nhelp for a woman who has left her husband. How far is the condoning of\\noffenses consistent with maintaining the standards of society? And in\\nwhat cases shall we apply the principle of forgiveness? In a business\\ntransaction how far can one push the Golden Rule? Life would be a\\nsimpler matter if moral principles were always easy to apply to concrete\\ncases.\\n\\nOne must use the appeal to moral principles, therefore, soberly and with\\ndiscretion. The good sense of readers will rebel if their moral sense is\\ncalled on unnecessarily; and even when they cannot explain why they\\nbelieve such an appeal unsound, yet their instincts will tell them that\\nit is so. The creator whose right hand is always rising to heaven to\\ncall God to witness disgusts the right feeling of his audience. On the\\nother hand, where moral principles are really concerned there should be\\nno compromise. If in a political campaign the issue is between honesty\\nand graft in the public service, or between an open discussion of all\\ndealings which touch the public good, and private bargaining with party\\nmanagers, the moral principles cannot be kept hidden. If a real moral\\nprinciple is seriously involved in any question, the debate must rise to\\nthe level of that principle and let practical considerations go. And\\nevery citizen who has the advantage of having had more education than\\nhis fellows is thereby placed under obligation to hold the debate to\\nthis higher level.\\n\\n58. The Appeal of Style. Finally, we have to consider the appeal to\\nthe emotions, which is the distinguishing essence of eloquence, and the\\nattempts at it. In part this appeal is through the appeal to principles\\nand associations which are close to the heart of the audience, in part\\nthrough concrete and figurative language, in part through the\\nindefinable thrill and music of style which lies beyond definition and\\ninstruction.\\n\\nThe appeal to venerated principle we have considered already, looked at\\nfrom the side of morals rather than of emotions. But morality, so far as\\nit is a coercive force in human conduct, is emotional; our moral\\nstandards lie beyond and above reason in that larger part of our nature\\nthat knows through feeling and intuition. All men have certain standards\\nand principles whose names arouse strong and reverent emotions. Such\\nstandards are not all religious or moral in the stricter sense; some of\\nthem have their roots in systems of government. In a case at law, argued\\npurely on a question of law, there does not seem much chance for the\\nappeal to feeling; but Mr. Joseph H. Choate, in his argument on the\\nconstitutionality of the Income Tax of 1894, before the Supreme Court\\nof the United States, made the following appeal to the principle of the\\nsanctity of private property, and the words he used could not have\\nfailed to stir deep and strong feelings in the court.\\n\\nNo longer ago, if the Court please, than the day of the funeral\\nprocession of General Sherman in New York, it was my fortune to spend\\nmany hours with one of the ex-Presidents of the United States, who has\\nsince followed that great warrior to the bourne to which we were then\\nbearing him. President Hayes expressed great solicitude as to the future\\nfortunes of this people. In his retirement he had been watching the\\ntendency of political and social purposes and events. He had observed\\nhow in recent years the possessors of political power had been learning\\nto use it for the first time for the promotion of social and personal\\nends. He said to me, \"You will probably live to see the day when in the\\ncase of the death of any man of large wealth the State will take for\\nitself all above a certain prescribed limit of his fortune and divide\\nit, or apply it to the equal use of all the people, so as to punish the\\nrich man for his wealth, and to divide it among those who, whatever may\\nhave been their sins, at least have not committed that.\" I looked upon\\nit as the wanderings of a dreaming man; and yet if I had known that\\nwithin less than five short years afterwards I should be standing before\\nthis tribunal to contest the validity of an alleged act of Congress, of\\na so-called law, which was defended here by the authorized legal\\nrepresentatives of the Federal Government upon the plea that it was a\\ntax levied only upon classes and extremely rich men, I should have given\\naltogether a different heed and ear to the warnings of that\\ndistinguished statesman.[62]\\n\\nOur emotions do not rise, however, anymore surely in the case of our\\nveneration for the basal principles of religion and government than in\\nthat of more personal emotions. The appeal to the Constitution is worn\\nsomewhat threadbare by the politicians who call on it at every election,\\nsmall or great, as is the appeal to the principles of the Pilgrim\\nFathers. It takes eloquence now to rouse our feelings about these\\nprinciples. If you have a case important enough to justify appeal to\\nsuch great principles and the skill in language to give your appeal\\nvitality, you may really arouse your readers. But, on the whole, it is\\nsound advice to say, Wait a few years before you call on them.\\n\\nThe second mode of appeal to the feelings of your audience, that through\\nconcrete and figurative language, is more within the reach of advocates\\nwho are still of college age. This is particularly true of the use of\\nconcrete language. It is a matter of common knowledge that men do not\\nrouse themselves over abstract principles; they will grant their assent,\\noften without really knowing what is implied by the general principle,\\nand go away yawning. On the other hand, the man who talks about the real\\nand actual things which you know is likely to keep your attention. This\\ngoes back to the truth that our emotions and feelings are primarily the\\nreaction to the concrete things that happen to us. The spontaneous\\nwhistling and humming of tunes that indicate a cheerful heart rise\\nnaturally as a response to the sunlight in spring; the fear at the\\nterror that flies in a nightmare is the instinctive and physical\\nreaction to indigestion; we sorrow over the loss of our own friends, but\\nnot over the loss of some one else\\'s. The stories that stir us are the\\nstories that deal with actual, tangible realities in such terms that\\nthey make us feel that we are living the story ourselves. Stevenson has\\nsome wise words on this subject in his essay, \"A Gossip on Romance.\" The\\ndoctrine holds true for the making of arguments.\\n\\nEven where as in Burke\\'s speech \"On Conciliation with America,\"\\nabstractness is not vagueness, the style would be more effective for the\\nricher feeling that hangs over and around a concrete vocabulary. The\\ngreat vividness of Macaulay\\'s style, and its bold over so many readers,\\nis largely due to his unfailing use of the specific word. If you will\\ntake the trouble to notice what arguments in the last few months have\\nseemed to you especially persuasive, you will be surprised to find how\\ndefinite and concrete the terms are that they use.\\n\\nAccordingly, if you wish to keep the readers of your argument awake and\\nattentive, use terms that touch their everyday experience. If you are\\narguing for the establishment of a commission form of government, give\\nin dollars and cents the sum that it cost under the old system to pave\\nthe three hundred yards of A Street, between 12th and 13th streets. The\\nlate Mr. Godkin of the New York _Evening Post_, in his lifelong campaign\\nagainst corrupt government, to bring home to his readers the actual\\nstate of their city government and the character of the men who ran it,\\nused their nicknames; \"Long John\" Corrigan, for example (if there had\\nbeen such a personage); and \"Bath-house John Somebody\" has been a\\nfeature of campaigns in Chicago. The value of such names when skillfully\\nused is that by their associations and connotation they do stir feeling.\\nLikewise if you are arguing before an audience of graduates for a change\\nfrom a group system to a free elective system in your college, you would\\nuse the names of courses with which they would be familiar and the names\\nof professors under whom they had studied. If you were arguing for the\\nintroduction of manual training into a school, you would make taxpayers\\ntake an interest in the matter if you gave them the exact numbers of\\npupils from that school who have gone directly into mills or other work\\nof the kind, and if you describe vividly just what is meant by manual\\ntraining. If your description is in general terms they may grant you\\nyour principle, and then out of mere inertia and a vague feeling against\\nchange vote the other way.\\n\\nA rough test for concreteness is your vocabulary: if your words are\\nmostly Anglo-Saxon you will usually be talking about concrete things; if\\nit is Latinate and polysyllabic it is probably abstract and general.\\nMost of the things and actions of everyday life, the individual things\\nlike \"walls\" and \"puppies,\" \"summer\" and \"boys,\" \"buying\" and \"selling,\"\\n\"praying\" and \"singing,\" have names belonging to the Anglo-Saxon part of\\nthe language; and though there are many exceptions, like \"tables,\" and\\n\"telephones,\" and \"professors,\" yet the more your vocabulary consists of\\nthe non-Latinate words, the more likely it is to be concrete, and\\ntherefore to keep your readers\\' attention and feelings alive. Use the\\nsimple terms of everyday life, therefore, rather than the learned words\\nwhich would serve you if you were generalizing from many cases. Stick to\\nthe single case before you and to the interests of the particular people\\nyou are trying to win over. To touch their feelings remember that you\\nmust talk about the things they have feelings about.\\n\\nThe use of similes and metaphors and other figurative language raises a\\ndifficult question. On the whole, perhaps the best advice about using\\nthem is, Don\\'t unless you have to. In other words, where a figure of\\nspeech is a necessity of expression, where you cannot make your thought\\nclear and impart to it the warmth of feeling with which it is clothed in\\nyour own mind except by a touch of imaginative color, then use a figure\\nof speech, if one flashes itself on your mind. If you add it\\ndeliberately as adornment of your speech, it will strike a false note;\\nif you laboriously invent it the effort will show. Unless your thought\\nand your eagerness for your subject flow naturally and inevitably into\\nan image, it is better to stick to plain speech, for any suggestion of\\ninsincerity is fatal to the persuasiveness of an argument.\\n\\nThe value of the figure of speech is chiefly in giving expression to\\nfeelings which cannot be set forth in abstract words, the whole of whose\\nmeaning can be defined: in the connotation of words--that indefinable\\npart of their meaning which consists in their associations,\\nimplications, and general emotional coloring--lies their power to clothe\\nthought with the rich color of feeling which is the life. At the same\\ntime, they serve as a fillip to the attention. There are not very many\\npeople who can long keep the mind fixed on a purely abstract line of\\nthought, and none can do it without some effort. Professor William James\\nis a notable example of a writer whose thought flowed spontaneously into\\nnecessary figures of speech:\\n\\nWhen one turns to the magnificent edifice of the physical sciences,\\nand sees how it was reared; what thousands of disinterested\\nmoral lives of men lie buried in its mere foundations; what patience\\nand postponement, what choking down of preference, what\\nsubmission to the icy laws of outer fact are wrought into its very\\nstones and mortar; how absolutely impersonal it stands in its vast\\naugustness,--then how besotted and contemptible seems every\\nlittle sentimentalist who comes blowing his voluntary smoke wreaths,\\nand pretending to decide things out of his private dream.[63]\\n\\nOne cannot go to sleep over a style like that, for besides the\\nobvious sincerity and rush of warm feeling, the vividness of\\nthe figures is like that of poetry. On the either hand, one\\nmust remember that it is given to few men to attain the\\nunstudied eloquence of Professor James.\\n\\nFables and anecdotes serve much the same purpose, but\\nmore especially throw into memorable form the principle\\nwhich they are intended to set forth. There are a good many\\ntruths which are either so complex or so subtle that they defy\\nphrasing in compact form, yet their truth we all know by intuition.\\nIf for such a truth you can find a compact illustration,\\nyou can leave it much more firmly fixed in your readers\\' minds\\nthan by any amount of systematic exposition. Lincoln in his\\nSpringfield speech, for example, threw into striking form the\\nfeeling which was so common in the North, that each step\\nforward in the advance of slavery so fitted into all earlier ones\\nthat something like a concerted plan must be assumed:\\n\\nWe cannot absolutely know that all these exact adaptations are, the\\nresult of preconcert. But when we see a lot of framed timbers, different\\nportions of which we know have been gotten cut at different times and\\nplaces and by different workmen,--Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James,\\nfor instance,--and we see these timbers joined together, and see they\\nexactly make the frame of a house or a mill, all the tenons and mortises\\nexactly fitting, and all the lengths and proportions of the different\\npieces exactly adapted to their respective places, and not a piece too\\nmany or too few, not omitting even scaffolding,--or, if a single piece\\nbe lacking, we see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared\\nyet to bring such piece in,--in such a case we find it impossible not to\\nbelieve that Stephen and Franklin and Roger and James all understood one\\nanother from the beginning, and all worked upon a common plan or draft\\ndrawn up before the first blow was struck.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there is the danger of being florid or of playing the\\nclown if you tell too many stories. Whether your style will seem florid\\nor not depends a good deal on the part of the country you are writing\\nfor. There is no doubt that the taste of the South and of a good deal of\\nthe West is for a style more varied and highly  than suits the\\nsoberer taste of the East. But whatever part of the country you are\\nwriting for, just so soon as your style seems to those special readers\\noverloaded with ornament it will seem insincere. In the same way, if you\\nstop too often to tell a story or to make your readers laugh, you will\\nproduce the impression of trifling with your subject. In both these\\nrespects be careful not to draw the attention of your readers away from\\nthe subject to your style.\\n\\nThe ultimate and least analyzable appeal of style is through that thrill\\nof the voice which in written style appears as rhythm and harmony.\\nCertain men are gifted with the capacity of so modulating their voices\\nand throwing virtue into their tones that whoever hears them feels an\\nindefinable thrill. So in writing: where sounds follow sounds in\\nharmonious sequence, and the beat of the accent approaches regularity\\nwithout falling into it, language takes on the expressiveness of music.\\nIt is well known that music expresses a range of feeling that lies\\nbeyond the powers of words: who can explain, for example, the thrill\\nroused in him by a good brass band, or the indefinable melancholy and\\ngloom created by the minor harmonies of one of the great funeral\\nmarches, or, in another direction, the impulse that sets him to\\nwhistling or singing on a bright morning in summer? There are many such\\nkinds of feeling, real and potent parts of our consciousness; and if we\\ncan bring them to expression at all, we must do so through the rhythm\\nand other sensuous qualities of the style which are pure sensation.\\n\\nHow is that to be done? The answer is difficult, and like that\\nconcerning the use of figurative language: do not try for it too\\ndeliberately. If without your thinking of it you find yourself becoming\\nmore earnest in speech, and more impressed with the seriousness of the\\nissue you are arguing, your voice will show it naturally. So when you\\nare writing: your earnestness will show, if you have had the training\\nand have the natural gift for expression in words, in a lengthening and\\nmore strongly marked rhythm, in an intangibly richer coloring of sound.\\nIn speech the rhythm is apt to be shown in what is called parallel\\nstructure, the repetition of the same form of sentence, and in\\nrhetorical questions. In writing, these forms more easily tend to seem\\neither excited or artificial. Sustained periodic structure, too, can be\\ncarried by the speaking voice, when it would lag if written. Every one\\nrecognizes this incommunicable thrill of eloquence in great speakers and\\nwriters, but it is so much a gift of nature that it is not wise\\nconsciously to cultivate it.\\n\\n59. Fairness and Sincerity. In the long run, however, nothing makes\\nan argument appeal more to readers than an air of fairness and\\nsincerity. If it is evident in an argument of fact that you are seeking\\nto establish the truth, or in an argument of policy that your single aim\\nis the greatest good of all concerned, your audience will listen to you\\nwith favorable ears. If on the other hand you seem to be chiefly\\nconcerned with the vanity of a personal victory, or to be thinking of\\nselfish advantages, they will listen to you coolly and with jealous\\nscrutiny of your points.\\n\\nAccordingly, in making your preliminary survey to prepare the statement\\nof the facts that are agreed on by both sides, go as far as you can in\\nyielding points. If the question is worth arguing at all you will still\\nhave your hands full to get through it within your space. In particular\\nwaive all trivial points: nothing is more wearisome to readers than to\\nplow through detailed arguments over points that no one cares about in\\nthe end. And meet the other side at least halfway in agreeing on the\\nfacts that do not need to be argued out. You will prejudice your\\naudience if you make concessions in a grudging spirit. Likewise,\\nwherever you have, to meet arguments put forward by the other side,\\nstate them with scrupulous fairness; if your audience has any reason to\\nsuppose that you are twisting the assertions of the other side to your\\nown advantage, you have shaken their confidence in you, and thereby\\nweakened the persuasive force of your argument. Use sarcasm with\\ncaution, and beware of any seeming of triumph. Sarcasm easily becomes\\ncheap, and an air of triumph may look like petty smartness.\\n\\nIn short, in writing your argument, assume throughout the attitude of\\none who is seeking earnestly to bring the disagreement between the two\\nsides to an end. If you are dealing with a question of fact, your sole\\nduty is to establish the truth. If you are dealing with a question of\\npolicy, you know when you begin that whichever way the decision goes,\\none side will suffer some disadvantage; but aim to lessen that\\ndisadvantage, and to discover a way that will bring the greatest gain to\\nthe greatest number. An obvious spirit of conciliation is a large asset\\nin persuasion.\\n\\nWith the conciliation make clear your sincerity. A chief difficulty with\\nmaking arguments written in school and college persuasive is that they\\nso often deal with subjects in which it is obvious that the writer\\'s own\\nfeelings are not greatly concerned. This difficulty will disappear when\\nyou get out into the world, and make arguments in earnest. A great part\\nof Lincoln\\'s success as an advocate is said to have been due to the fact\\nthat he always tried to compose his cases and to make peace between the\\nlitigants, and that he never took a case in which he did not believe. If\\nyou leave on your audience the impression that you are sincere and in\\nearnest, you have taken a long step towards winning over their feelings.\\n\\nOn the whole, then, when one is considering the question of persuasion,\\nthe figure of speech of a battle is not very apt. It is all very well\\nwhen you are laying out your brief to speak, of deploying your various\\npoints, of directing an attack on your opponent\\'s weakest point, of\\nbringing up reserve material in rebuttal; but if the figure gets you\\ninto the way of thinking that you must always demolish your opponent,\\nand treat him as an enemy, it is doing harm. If you will take the\\ntrouble to follow the controversies which are going on in your own city\\nand state over public affairs, you will soon see that in most of them\\nthe two sides break even, so far as intelligence and public-spiritedness\\ngo. In every transaction there are two sides; and the president of a\\nstreet railroad may be as honest and as disinterested in seeking to get\\nthe best of the bargain for his road as the representatives of the city\\nare in trying to get the best of it for the public. There is no use\\ngoing into a question of this sort with the assumption that you are on a\\nhigher moral plane than the other side. In some cases where a moral\\nissue is involved there is only one view of what is right; if honesty is\\nin the balance, there can be no other side. But, as we have seen, there\\nare moral questions in which one must use his utmost strength for the\\nright as he sees the right, and yet know all the time that equally\\nhonest men are fighting just as hard on the other side. No American who\\nremembers the case of General Robert E. Lee can forget this puzzling\\ntruth. Therefore, unless there can be no doubt of the dishonesty of your\\nopponent, turn your energies against his cause and not against him; and\\nhold that the proper end of argument is not so much to win victories as\\nto bring as many people as possible to agreement.\\n\\n\\nEXERCISES\\n\\n1.

The essential difference between debate\\nand written argument lies not so much in the natural difference between\\nall spoken and written discourse as in the fact that in a debate of any\\nkind there is the chance for an immediate answer to an opponent.\\nQuickness of wit to see the weak points on the other side, readiness in\\nattacking them, and resource in defending one\\'s own points make the\\ndebater, as distinguished from the man who, if he be given plenty of\\ntime, can make a formidable and weighty argument in writing. The best\\ndebating is heard in deliberative bodies which are not too large, and\\nwhere the rules are not too elaborate. Perhaps the best in the world is\\nin the British House of Commons, for there the room is not so large that\\nhearing is difficult, and skill in thrust and parry has been valued and\\npracticed for generations.\\n\\nThe military figure for argument is more apposite in debate than\\nanywhere else, for in the taking of the vote there is an actual victory\\nand defeat, very different in nature from the barren decision of judges\\nin intercollegiate and interscholastic contests. It is undoubtedly rare\\nthat a particular debate in any legislative body actually changes the\\nresult; but in the long run the debates in such bodies do mold public\\nopinion, and within the body amalgamate or break up party ties. The\\nresource and the ready knowledge of the subject under debate necessary\\nto hold one\\'s own in such running contests of wit Is an almost essential\\ncharacteristic of a party leader. It is on these two qualities that I\\nshall chiefly dwell in this chapter.\\n\\n61. Subjects for Debate. Debate almost always deals with questions\\nof policy. In trials before a jury there is something approaching a\\ndebate over questions of fact; but the rules of evidence are so special,\\nand within their range so strict, that even though the arguments are\\nspoken, they can have little of the free give and take which makes the\\nlife and the interest of a real debate. Accordingly I shall draw my\\nillustrations here from questions of policy, and so far as is possible\\nfrom the sort of question that students are likely to turn their\\nattention to. The later years of school and the whole of the college\\ncourse are often the molding years for a man\\'s views on all sorts of\\npublic questions. It has been said that a man\\'s views rarely change\\nafter he is twenty-five years old; and though one must not take such a\\ndictum too literally, yet unquestionably it has truth. At any rate it is\\ncertain that a student, whether in high school or college, if he is to\\ndo his duty as a citizen, must begin to think out many of the questions\\nwhich are being decided in Congress, in state legislatures, and in\\nsmaller, more local bodies. At the same time, in every school and\\ncollege questions are constantly under discussion of a nature to provide\\ngood practice in debate. Some of these questions must be decided by\\nschool committee, principal, faculty, or trustees, and most of them call\\nfor some looking up of facts. They would provide admirable material for\\nthe development of judgment and resource in debating, and in some cases\\na debate on them might have effect on the actual decision.\\n\\nThe choice of subject is even more important for debating than for\\nwritten argument. In a written argument if you have a question which has\\ntwo defensible sides, it does not make much difference whether one is\\neasier to defend than the other: in a debate such a difference might\\ndestroy the usefulness of the subject. Though to some older minds the\\nabolition of football is a debatable question, before an audience of\\nundergraduates who had to vote on the merits of the question the subject\\nwould be useless, since the side which had to urge the abolition would\\nhere have an almost impossible task. So in a debate on the \"closed\\nshop,\" in most workingmen\\'s clubs the negative would be able to\\naccomplish little, for the other side would be intrenched in the\\nprejudices and prepossessions of the audience. In political bodies\\nunevenness of sides is of common occurrence, for a minority must always\\ndefend its doctrines, no matter how overwhelming the vote is certain to\\nbe. In the formal debates of school and college, on the other hand,\\nwhere the conditions must be more or less artificial, the first\\ncondition is to choose a question which will give the two sides an even\\nchance.\\n\\nA fair test of this evenness of sides is to see whether the public which\\nis concerned with the question is evenly divided: if about the same\\nnumber of men who are acquainted with the subject and are recognized as\\nfair-minded take opposite sides, the question is probably a good subject\\nfor debate. Even this test, however, may be deceptive, since believing a\\npolicy to be sound and being able to show that it is so are very\\ndifferent matters. The reasons for introducing the honor system into a\\ncertain school or college are probably easier to state and to support\\nthan the reasons against introducing it; yet the latter may be\\nunquestionably weighty.\\n\\nIn general, arguments which rest on large and more or less abstract\\nprinciples are at a disadvantage as against arguments based on some\\nimmediate and pressing evil or on some obvious expediency. Arguments for\\nor against a protective tariff on general principles of political\\neconomy are harder to make interesting and, therefore, cogent to the\\naverage audience than are those based on direct practical gains or\\nlosses. This difference in the ease with which the two sides of a\\nquestion can be argued must be taken into account in the choice of a\\nsubject.\\n\\nIn the second place, the subject should be so phrased that it will\\ninevitably produce a \"head-on\" collision between the two sides. If such\\na proposition as \"The present city government should be changed\" were\\nchosen for a debate, one side might argue it as a question of the party\\nor of the men who happened to be in control at the time, and the other\\nas a question of the form of government. So on the question of\\nself-government for a college or school, unless the type of\\nself-government were carefully defined, the two sides might argue\\nthrough the debate and not come in sight of each other. What was said in\\nChapter II about framing the proposition for an argument applies with\\neven more force to finding the proposition for a debate; for here if\\nthey do not meet on an irreconcilable difference, there is little use in\\ntheir coming together.\\n\\nIn the third place, it is desirable that the proposition should be so\\nframed as to throw the burden of proof on the affirmative. Unless the\\nside which opens the debate has something definite to propose, the\\ndebate must open more or less lamely, for it is hard to attack or oppose\\nsomething which is going to be set forth after you have finished\\ntalking. Here, however, as in the case of written arguments, it must be\\nremembered that burden of proof is a vague and slippery term; \"he who\\nasserts must prove\" is a maxim that in debate applies to the larger\\nissues only, and the average audience will give themselves little\\ntrouble about the finer applications of it. If you are proposing a\\nchange in present conditions, and the present conditions are not very\\nbad, they will expect you to show why there should be a change, and to\\nmake clear that the change you propose will work an improvement. It is\\nonly when conditions have become intolerable that an audience thinks\\nfirst of the remedy. In the ordinary school or college, for example,\\nthere is little reason in current conditions for introducing the honor\\nsystem in examinations: in such a case the burden of proof on the\\naffirmative would be obvious, If, however, as occasionally happens,\\nthere has been an epidemic of dishonesty in written work, then the\\nauthorities of the school and the parents would want to know why there\\nshould not be a change. But it would both bore and confuse an audience\\nto explain to them at length the theory of the shifting of the burden of\\nproof; and the chances are that they would say, \"Why doesn\\'t he prove\\nhis point, and not spend his time beating about the bush?\"\\n\\nFinally, the proposition should, if possible, give to the negative as\\nwell as to the affirmative some constructive argument. If one side\\noccupies itself wholly with showing the weakness of the arguments on the\\nother side, you get nowhere on the merits of the question; for all that\\nhas been shown in the debate, the proposition put forward by the\\naffirmative may be sound, and the only weakness lie in its defenders.\\nMoreover, where the negative side finds no constructive argument on the\\nmerits of the question, or elects to confine itself to destructive,\\narguments, it must beware of the fallacy \"of objections\"; that is, of\\nassuming that when it has brought forward some objections to the\\nproposition it has settled the matter. As I have so often pointed out in\\nthis treatise, no question is worth arguing unless it has two sides; and\\nthat is merely saying, in another way, that to both sides there are\\nreasonable objections. Where a negative side confines itself to\\ndestructive arguments it must make clear that the objections it presents\\nare really destructive, or at any rate are clearly more grave than those\\nwhich can be brought against leaving things as they are. And if they\\nconfine themselves to destroying the arguments brought forward by the\\naffirmative in this particular debate, they must make clear that these\\narguments are the strongest that can be brought forward on that side.\\n\\nOn all questions as to construction of terms and burden of proof, it\\nshould be understood beforehand that the judges of a formal debate will\\nheavily penalize anything like pettifogging or quibbling. The two sides\\nshould do their best to come to a \"head-on\" issue; and any attempt at\\nstanding on precise definition, or sharp practice in leading the other\\nside away from the main question, should be held to be not playing the\\ngame. Where the judges are drawn from men of experience in affairs, as\\nis usually the case, they will estimate such boyish smartnesses at their\\ntrue value.\\n\\n62. Technical Forms. The formal debates of school and college have\\ncertain forms and conventions which are partly based on parliamentary\\nprocedure, partly have been worked out to make these debates more\\ninteresting and better as practice; and there are certain preliminary\\narrangements that improve debating both as intellectual training and as\\nfun. I shall speak first of the forms and conventions.\\n\\nIn debates in school and college it is usual to have two or three on a\\nside, and for good reasons. In the first place, the labor of working up\\nthe subject is shared, and it is better fun working with some one else.\\nThen, in the debate itself there is more variety. In class debates there\\nare usually two speakers on each side, with provision of time for\\nseveral four- or five-minute speeches from the floor before the closing\\nspeeches in rebuttal.[64] If there are as many speakers as this a\\ntwo-hour period must be allowed. This allotment of time will naturally\\nbe adapted to special conditions; as, for example, where it is desirable\\nthat there shall be more speakers from the floor, or where it is desired\\nto give the whole time to the regular debaters. In important\\nintercollegiate debates there are usually three speakers, each of whom\\nhas ten minutes for his main speech and five minutes for rebuttal. This\\narrangement varies greatly, however, in different places, and not\\ninfrequently there is only one speech in rebuttal. The affirmative is\\nusually given the last speech, on the theory that it is a disadvantage\\nto have to open the debate. Obviously, however, in practice the reverse\\nmay often be true, since a skillful speech in opening may largely\\ndetermine the course of the debate; and for this reason many debating\\nsocieties and colleges allow the closing speech to the negative. It is\\nwise not to look on any of these rules as inviolable.[65]\\n\\nThe distribution of the points between the speakers on a side should be\\nmade beforehand, but always with the understanding that the exigencies\\nof the debate may upset the arrangement. We shall see presently the\\nadvantage there is in having each member of a \"team\" prepared to defend\\nall the points on his side. The only speech for which a fixed program\\ncan be made beforehand is the first speech on the affirmative: obviously\\nthis must at any rate expound the main facts which the audience must\\nknow in order to understand the speeches that follow. After that each\\nspeaker should be prepared either to answer directly what has just been\\nsaid or to explain why he postpones the answer. At the same time, unless\\nhis hand has been forced, he must make the point or points which have\\nbeen committed to him in the preliminary plan of campaign. Each speaker\\nafter the first generally takes a minute or two to sum up the position\\nas his side sees it; and the final speaker on each side ought to save\\ntime to recapitulate and drive home the main points that his side has\\nmade and the chief objections to the arguments on the other side. Beyond\\nthese suggestions, which should not be allowed to harden into invariable\\nrules, much must be left to the swift judgment of the debaters. It is a\\ngood test of skill in debating to know just when to stick to such rules,\\nand when to break away from them.\\n\\nA debater uses certain forms which have long been established in\\nparliamentary law. To begin with, he never uses the name of his\\nopponent: if he has to refer to him he refers indirectly in some such\\nform as \"the last speaker,\" \"the first speaker for the affirmative,\"\\n\"the gentlemen from Wisconsin,\" \"our opponents,\" \"my colleague who has\\njust spoken.\" This is an inviolable rule of all debating bodies, whether\\na class in school or college or one of the Houses of Congress.\\n\\nIn a formal debate the subject is stated by the presiding officer, who\\nis usually not one of the judges, and he also introduces each of the\\nspeakers in the order agreed on beforehand.\\n\\nIn class debates the subject is usually given out by the instructor, who\\nmay assign the speakers, or may call for volunteers, or may let each\\nmember of the class take his turn in regular rotation. This distribution\\nwill usually work itself out to suit the class and the circumstances. In\\ninterscholastic and intercollegiate debates the subject is generally\\nchosen by letting one side offer a number of subjects from which the\\nother selects one. Sometimes the team which does not have the choice of\\nsubject has the choice of sides after the other team has picked the\\nsubject. In a triangular debate two or three subjects are proposed by\\neach team, and then one is selected by preferential voting of all the\\ncontestants, first choice counting three points, second two, and third\\none. In such a contest each institution has two teams, one of which\\nsupports the affirmative, and the other the negative; and the three\\ndebates take place on the same day or evening.\\n\\nIn class debates the two sides should unite in preparing an agreed\\nstatement of facts, which shall contain so much of the history of the\\ncase as is pertinent, facts and issues which it is agreed shall be\\nwaived, and a statement of the main issues. Furthermore, it is highly\\ndesirable that the sides should submit to each other outline briefs\\ncovering the main points of their case. With such preparations there is\\nlittle probability that there can be any failure to meet. The same\\npreparations would be useful in interscholastic and intercollegiate\\ndebates, wherever they are practicable. Anything which leads to a\\nthorough discussion of identical points and to the consequent\\nillumination of the question makes these entertainments more valuable.\\n\\nFor intercollegiate and interscholastic debates it is wise to have some\\nsort of instructions for the judges, which should be agreed on\\nbeforehand. These instructions must make clear that the decision is to\\nturn not on the merits of the question, as in real life, but on the\\nmerits of the debaters. Among those merits the substance should count\\nmuch more than the form. Of the points that count in judging the\\nsubstance of the debate the instructions may note keenness of analysis,\\npower of exposition, thoroughness of preparation, judgment in the\\nselection of evidence, readiness and effectiveness in rebuttal, and\\ngrasp of the subject as a whole. For form the instructions may mention\\nbearing, ease and appropriateness of gesture, quality and expressiveness\\nof voice, enunciation and pronunciation, and general effectiveness of\\ndelivery. Sometimes these points are drawn up with percentages to\\nsuggest their proportionate weight; but it is doubtful whether so exact\\na calculation can ever be of practical value. In most cases the judges\\nwill decide from a much less articulate sense of which side has the\\nadvantage.[66]\\n\\n63. Preparations for Debating. Since the chief value of debating,\\nas distinguished from written arguments, is in cultivating readiness and\\nflexibility of wit, the speaking should be as far as possible\\nextemporaneous. This does not imply that the speaking should be without\\npreparation: on the contrary, the preparation for good debating is more\\narduous than for a written argument, for when you are on your feet on\\nthe platform you cannot run to your books or to your notes to refresh\\nyour memory or to find new material. The ideal debater is the man who so\\ncarries the whole subject in his mind that the facts flow to his mind as\\nhe talks, and fit into the plan of his argument without a break. To the\\nrare men who remember everything they read, such readiness is natural,\\nbut to far the largest number of speakers it comes only through hard\\nstudy of the material. Daniel Webster declared that the material for his\\nfamous Reply to Hayne had been in his desk for months. In so far as\\ndebating consists in the recitation of set speeches written out and\\ncommitted to memory beforehand, it throws away most of what makes\\ndebating valuable, and tends to become elocution. We shall consider\\nhere, therefore, ways in which speakers can make themselves so familiar\\nwith the subject to be debated that they can confidently cut loose from\\ntheir notes.\\n\\nIn the first place, each debater on a team should prepare himself on the\\nwhole subject, not only on the whole of his own side, but also on the\\nwhole of the other side. It is usual to divide up the chief points that\\na team is to make among its different members; but in the sudden turns\\nto which every debate is liable such assignment may easily become\\nimpossible. If the other side presents new material or makes a point in\\nsuch a way as manifestly to impress the audience, the next speaker may\\nhave to throw over the point assigned to him and give himself\\nimmediately to refuting the arguments just made. Then his points must be\\nleft to his colleagues, and they must be able to use them to effect.\\nLikewise a team should know the strong points on the other side as well\\nas on its own, and come to the platform primed with arguments to meet\\nthem. In intercollegiate contests, to insure this fore-knowledge of the\\nother side the speakers as part of their preparation meet men from their\\nown college who argue out the other side in detail and at length. In a\\ntriangular contest each team from a college has the advantage of having\\nworked up the subject in actual debate against the other. The more\\nthoroughly you have worked up both sides of the question, the less\\nlikely are you to be taken by surprise by some argument which you do not\\nknow how to meet.\\n\\n64. On the Platform. When it comes to the actual debate experience\\nshows that speeches committed to memory are almost always ineffective as\\ncompared with extemporaneous speaking. Even when your confidence is not\\ndisturbed by a slippery memory there is an impalpable touch of the\\nartificial about the prepared speech which impairs its vitality. On the\\nother hand, especially with the first speeches on each side, you cannot\\nget to your feet and trust entirely to the inspiration of the moment;\\nyou must have something thought out. One of the most notable lecturers\\nin Harvard University prepares his lectures in a way which is an\\nexcellent model for debaters. He writes out beforehand a complete\\nanalytical and tabulated plan of his lecture, similar to the briefs\\nwhich have been recommended here in Chapter II, with each of the main\\nprinciples of his lecture, and with the subdivisions and illustrations\\ninserted. Then he leaves this outline at home and talks from a full and\\nwell-ordered mind. Some such plan is the best possible one for the main\\nspeeches in a debate. Often the plan can be most easily prepared by\\nwriting out the argument in full; and this expansion of the argument has\\nthe added advantage of providing you with much of your phrasing. But it\\nis better not to commit the complete argument to memory: the brief of\\nit, if thoroughly digested and so studied as to come readily to mind, is\\nenough. Then practice, practice, practice, will give the ease and\\nfluency that you need.\\n\\nThe rebuttal should always be extemporaneous. Even if you have foreseen\\nthe strongest points made by your opponent and prepared yourself to meet\\nthem, you cannot foresee just the way he will make the points. Nothing\\nis more awkward in a debate than to begin with a few obviously\\nextemporaneous remarks, and then to let loose a little speech which has\\nbeen kept, as it were, in cold storage, and which just misses fitting\\nthe speech to which it should be an answer. It is better to make the\\nrebuttal a little less sweeping than it might be and have it fall pat on\\nthe speech which it is attacking. Ready and spontaneous skill in\\nrebuttal is the final excellence of debating. At the same time the skill\\nshould be so natural that wit and good humor may have their chance. If\\nfrom the beginning you practice making your speeches in rebuttal\\noffhand, you will constantly gain in confidence when you are called on\\nto speak.\\n\\nWhether to take notes on to the platform or not is a somewhat disputed\\nquestion. If you can speak without them and hold without stumbling to\\nthe main course of your argument, so much the better. On the other hand,\\nmost lawyers have their briefs when they are arguing on points of law,\\nand some sort of rough notes when they are arguing before a jury; and\\nwhen unassumingly and naturally used, notes are hardly observed by an\\naudience. Only, if you do have notes, do not try to conceal them: hold\\nthem so that the audience will know what they are, and will not wonder\\nwhat you are doing when you peer into the palm of your hand.\\n\\nIf you have passages to quote from a book or other document, have the\\nbook on the table beside you; its appearance will add substance to your\\npoint, and the audience will have ocular proof that you are quoting\\nexactly.\\n\\nFor purposes of rebuttal it is usual to have material on cards arranged\\nunder the principal subdivisions of the subject, so that they can\\nreadily be found. These cards can be kept in the small wooden or\\npasteboard boxes that are sold for the purpose at college stationers. If\\nthe cards have the proper kind of headings, you can easily look them\\nover while your opponent is speaking and pull out the few that bear on\\nthe point you are to meet. Examples of these cards have been given in\\nChapter II. The important thing for their use in a debate is to have the\\nheadings so clear and pertinent that you can instantly find the\\nparticular card you want. Naturally you will have made yourself\\nthoroughly familiar with them beforehand.\\n\\nWhen you have to use statistics, simplify them so that your hearers can\\ntake them in without effort. Large numbers should be given in round\\nfigures, except where some special emphasis or perhaps some semihumorous\\neffect is to be gained by giving them in full. Quotations from books or\\nspeeches must of necessity be short: where you have only ten minutes\\nyourself you cannot give five minutes to the words of another man.\\n\\nKeep your audience in good humor; if you can occasion ally relieve the\\nsolemnity of the occasion by making them laugh, they will like you the\\nbetter for it, and think none the worse of your argument. On the other\\nhand, remember that such diversion is incidental, and that your main\\nbusiness is to deal seriously with a serious question. The uneasy\\nself-consciousness that keeps a man always trying to be funny is\\nnowhere more out of place than in a debate.\\n\\n65. Voice and Position. The matter of delivery is highly important,\\nand here no man can trust to the light of nature. Any voice can be made\\nto carry further and to be more expressive, and the poorest and thinnest\\nvoice can be improved. Every student who has a dream of being a public\\nspeaker should take lessons in elocution or in singing or in both. The\\nexpressiveness as well as the carrying power and the endurance of a\\nvoice depend on a knowledge of how to use the muscles of the chest,\\nthroat, and face; and trainers of the voice have worked out methods for\\nthe proper use of all these sets of muscles. A man who throws his breath\\nfrom the top of his chest and does not use the great bellows that reach\\ndown to his diaphragm can get little carrying power. So with the throat:\\nif it is stiff and pinched the tones will be high and forced, and\\nlistening to them will tire the audience nearly as much as making them\\nwill tire the speaker. Finally, the expressiveness of a voice, the\\nthrill that unconsciously but powerfully stirs hearers, is largely a\\nmatter of the resonance that comes from the spaces above the mouth and\\nbehind the nose. A humorous singing teacher once declared that the soul\\nresides in the bridge of the nose; and the saying is not so paradoxical\\nas it sounds. Lessons in the use of all these parts, and faithful\\npractice in the exercises which go with them, are essential for any man\\nwho wishes to make a mark in public speaking.\\n\\nWith the use of the voice, though less essential, goes the position and\\nbearing on the platform. It is not necessary to insist that the more\\nnatural this is, the better. If you can wholly forget yourself and think\\nonly of your points, the chances are that your attitudes and position\\nwill take care of themselves. Only, before thus forgetting yourself,\\nform the habit of talking without putting your hands in your pockets.\\nYou ought to need your hands to talk with, if not as much as a Frenchman\\nor an Italian, yet enough to emphasize your points naturally. The mere\\nphysical stimulus to the eye of an audience in following your movements\\nwill help to keep their attention awake. Every one who has tried\\nlecturing to a large class knows how much easier it is to hold them if\\nhe stands up and moves a little from time to time. Learn to stand easily\\nand naturally, with your chest well expanded, and your weight\\ncomfortably balanced on your feet. If it comes natural to you, move\\nabout the stage slightly from time to time; but be careful not to look\\neach time you move as if a string had been pulled. In attitude and\\ngesture the only profitable council is, Be natural.\\n\\nFor all these matters of preparation, both of what you are going to say,\\nthe use of your voice, and your attitude and action on the platform, be\\nprepared for hard practice with competent criticism. It is a good plan\\nto practice talking from your outlines with your watch open, until you\\ncan bring your speech to an end in exactly the time allowed you. The\\ngain in confidence when you go to the debate will in itself be worth the\\ntime. Again, practice speaking before a glass to make sure that you have\\nno tricks of scowling or of making faces when you talk, and to get used\\nto standing up straight and holding yourself well. What you see for\\nyourself of your own ways will help you more than the advice of a\\ncritic.\\n\\nBut in all your preparation think beyond the special debate you are\\npreparing for. What you are or should be aiming at is habit--the\\ninstinctive, spontaneous execution of rules which you have forgotten.\\nWhen the habit is established you can let all these questions of voice,\\nof attitude, of gesture, drop from your mind, and give your whole\\nattention to the ideas you are developing, and the language in which you\\nshall clothe them. Then the tones of your voice will respond to the\\nearnestness of your feeling, and your gestures will be the spontaneous\\nresponse to the emphasis of your thought. You will not be a perfect\\ndebater until all these matters are regulated from the unconscious\\ndepths of your mind.\\n\\nIn your attitude towards the debaters on the other side be scrupulously\\nfair and friendly. In class debates the matter is finished when the\\ndebate is over; and what you are after is skill, and not beating some\\none. In interscholastic and intercollegiate debates victory is the end;\\nbut even there, after the debate you will often go out to supper with\\nyour opponents. Therefore demolish their arguments, but do not smash\\ntheir makers.\\n\\nIf the first speech falls to you, set forth the facts in such a way that\\nnot only your opponents will have no corrections or protests to make,\\nbut that they will be wholly willing to make a start from your\\nfoundation. Yield all trivial points: it is a waste of your time and\\nproof of an undeveloped sense of proportion to haggle over points that\\nin the end nobody cares about. You have won a point if you can make the\\naudience and the judges feel that you are anxious to allow everything\\npossible to the other side.\\n\\nIf your opponent trips on some small point of fact or reasoning, don\\'t\\nheckle him; let it pass, or, at the most, point it out with some kindly\\ntouch of humor. If his facts or his reasoning are wrong on important\\npoints, that is your opportunity, and you must make the most of it.\\nEven then, however, stick to the argument, and keep away from any\\nappearance of being personal.\\n\\n66. The Morals of Debating. There is a moral or ethical side to\\npractice in debating which one cannot ignore. It is dangerous to get\\ninto the habit of arguing lightly for things in which one does not\\nbelieve; and students may be forced into doing this if great care is not\\ntaken in the choice of subjects and sides. The remedy lies in using, so\\nfar as they can be kept interesting, questions in which there is no\\nmoral element; but still better in assigning sides to correspond with\\nthe actual views and preferences of the debaters. Where a question of\\nprinciple is involved no one should ever argue against his beliefs. The\\nbetter class of lawyers are scrupulous about this: they will not accept\\na brief which they believe to be in a cause which ought not to win. If\\nyou have clearly made up your mind on a question of public policy, you\\nare in a false position if you argue, even for practice, against what\\nyou believe to be the right.\\n\\nThe formal debates of school and college are of necessity barren of\\npractical result; yet even here your discussions have a potent effect in\\nmolding your opinions. It is a habit of mankind to start idly talking on\\na subject, and as idly taking sides; then, when the talk grows warmer,\\nin the natural desire to carry a point to talk themselves into belief.\\nThis is a human, though not a very reasonable way of framing your views\\non public questions; and it does not make either for consistency or for\\nusefulness as a voter. It is not good to back one\\'s self into opinions\\nof what makes for the common weal.\\n\\nFurthermore, debate is something very different from dispute: to talk\\nround and round a subject, contradicting blindly and asserting without\\nbringing forward facts, has its place in our life with our friends, so\\nlong as it is good-natured; but it does not bring illumination. The\\nessence of debate, whether in a classroom, in a city council, or in\\nCongress, should be to throw light into dark corners, and to disentangle\\nthe view that most makes for the general good. For us in America\\n_noblesse oblige_ applies to every educated man. The graduate of a high\\nschool, and, even more, the graduate of a college, has taken exceptional\\nbenefits from the community. This obligation he can in part repay by\\nhelping all citizens to a better understanding of the issues on which\\nthe progress of the nation turns.\\n\\nFinally, debating should share the zest that comes of any good game that\\nmeans hard work and an honorable struggle with opponents one respects\\nand likes. It is preeminently a social occupation. The House of Commons\\nhas long been noted as the best club in England; and this sense of\\nfellowship, of continuing friendship and intimacy, gives a charm to\\nEnglish parliamentary life which is hardly possible with the unwieldy\\nnumbers and huge hall of our own House of Representatives, but does\\nspring out of the smaller and continuing membership of the Senate. A\\nclass in debating should have the sense of comradeship which comes of\\nhard work together and the trying out of one\\'s own powers against one\\'s\\nequals and betters, and from the memory of hard-fought contests; and\\nintercollegiate and interscholastic contests should be carried on in the\\nsame spirit of zest in the hard work, of a sane desire to win, and of\\ncomradeship with worthy opponents.\\n\\nEXERCISES\\n\\n1.

HUXLEY\\n\\nThis is the first of three lectures which make a continuous argument,\\nwhich were delivered in New York. September 18, 20, and 22, 1876. It\\nshould therefore be regarded as the introductory part of the argument;\\nand as a matter of fact it does not get to Huxley\\'s positive proof, but\\nis occupied with disposing of the other theories. This refutation\\nfinished, Huxley was then at liberty to go ahead with the affirmative\\nargument, as he indicates in the last paragraph of the lecture.\\n\\nThe argument is a notable piece of reasoning on a scientific subject, in\\nterms which make it intelligible to all educated men. When Huxley spoke,\\nthe heat which had been kindled by the first announcement of the theory\\nof evolution in Darwin\\'s \"Origin of Species\" was still blazing; and\\nthere were many church people who held that the theory was subversive of\\nreligion, without giving themselves the trouble to understand it. This\\ntimid frame of mind explains Hurley\\'s mode of approach to the subject.\\n\\nWe live in and form part of a system of things of immense diversity and\\nperplexity, which we call Nature; and it is a matter of the deepest\\ninterest to all of us that we should form just conceptions of the\\nconstitution of that system and of its past history. With relation to\\nthis universe, man is, in extent, little more than a mathematical point:\\nin duration but a fleeting shadow: he is a mere reed shaken in the winds\\nof force. But, as Pascal long ago remarked, although a mere reed, he is\\na thinking reed; and in virtue of that wonderful capacity of thought, he\\nhas the power of framing for himself a symbolic conception of the\\nuniverse, which, although doubtless highly imperfect and inadequate as a\\npicture of the great whole, is yet sufficient to serve him as a chart\\nfor the guidance of his practical affairs. It has taken long ages of\\ntoilsome and often fruitless labor to enable man to look steadily at the\\nshifting scenes of the phantasmagoria of Nature, to notice what is fixed\\namong her fluctuations, and what is regular among her apparent\\nirregularities; and it is only comparatively lately, within the last few\\ncenturies, that the conception of a universal order and of a definite\\ncourse of things, which we term the course of Nature, has emerged.\\n\\nBut, once originated, the conception of the constancy of the order of\\nNature has become the dominant idea of modern thought. To any person who\\nis familiar with the facts upon which that conception is based, and is\\ncompetent to estimate their significance, it has ceased to be\\nconceivable that chance should have any place in the universe, or that\\nevents should depend upon any but the natural sequence of cause and\\neffect. We have come to look upon the present as the child of the past\\nand as the parent of the future; and, as we have excluded chance from a\\nplace in the universe, so we ignore, even as a possibility, the notion\\nof any interference with the order of Nature. Whatever may be men\\'s\\nspeculative doctrines, it is quite certain that every intelligent person\\nguides his life and risks his fortune upon the belief that the order of\\nNature is constant, and that the chain of natural causation is never\\nbroken.\\n\\nIn fact, no belief which we entertain has so complete a logical basis as\\nthat to which I have just referred. It tacitly underlies every process\\nof reasoning; it is the foundation of every act of the will. It is based\\nupon the broadest induction, and it is verified by the most constant,\\nregular, and universal of deductive processes. But we must recollect\\nthat any human belief, however broad its basis, however defensible it\\nmay seem, is, after all, only a probable belief, and that our widest and\\nsafest generalizations are simply statements of the highest, degree of\\nprobability. Though we are quite clear about the constancy of the order\\nof Nature, at the present time, and in the present state of things, it\\nby no means necessarily follows that we are justified in expanding this\\ngeneralization into the infinite past, and in denying, absolutely, that\\nthere may have been a time when Nature did not follow a fixed order,\\nwhen the relations of cause and effect were not definite, and when\\nextranatural agencies interfered with the general course of Nature.\\nCautious men will allow that a universe so different from that which we\\nknow may have existed; just as a very candid thinker may admit that a\\nworld in which two and two do not make four, and in which two straight\\nlines do inclose a space, may exist. But the same caution which forces\\nthe admission of such possibilities demands a great deal of evidence\\nbefore it recognizes them to be anything more substantial. And when it\\nis asserted that, so many thousand years ago, events occurred in a\\nmanner utterly foreign to and inconsistent with the existing laws of\\nNature, men, who without being particularly cautious, are simply honest\\nthinkers, unwilling to deceive themselves or delude others, ask for\\ntrustworthy evidence of the fact. Did things so happen or did they not?\\nThis is a historical question, and one the answer to which must be\\nsought in the same way as the solution of any other historical problem.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nSo far as I know, there are only three hypotheses which ever have been\\nentertained, or which well can be entertained, respecting the past\\nhistory of Nature. I will, in the first place, state the hypotheses, and\\nthen I will consider what evidence bearing upon them is in our\\npossession, and by what light of criticism that evidence is to be\\ninterpreted.\\n\\nUpon the first hypothesis, the assumption is, that phenomena of Nature\\nsimilar to those exhibited by the present world have always existed; in\\nother words, that the universe has existed from all eternity in what may\\nbe broadly termed its present condition.\\n\\nThe second hypothesis is, that the present state of things has had only\\na limited duration; and that, at some period in the past, a condition of\\nthe world, essentially similar to that winch we now know, came into\\nexistence, without any precedent condition from which it could have\\nnaturally proceeded. The assumption that successive stales of Nature\\nhave arisen, each without any relation of natural causation to an\\nantecedent state, is a mere modification of this second hypothesis.\\n\\nThe third hypothesis also assumes that the present state of things has\\nhad but a limited duration; but it Supposes that this state has been\\nevolved by a natural process from an antecedent state, and that from\\nanother, and so on; and, on this hypothesis, the attempt to assign any\\nlimit to the series of past changes is, usually, given up.\\n\\nIt is so needful to form clear and distinct notions of what is really\\nmeant by each of these hypotheses that I will ask you to imagine what,\\naccording to each, would have been visible to a spectator of the events\\nwhich constitute the history of the earth. On the first hypothesis,\\nhowever far back in time that spectator might be placed, he would see a\\nworld essentially, though perhaps not in all its details, similar to\\nthat which now exists. The animals which existed would be the ancestors\\nof those which now live, and similar to them; the plants, in like\\nmanner, would be such as we know; and the mountains, plains, and waters\\nwould foreshadow the salient features of our present land and water.\\nThis view was held more or less distinctly, sometimes combined with the\\nnotion of recurrent cycles of change, in ancient times; and its\\ninfluence has been felt down to the present day. It is worthy of remark\\nthat it is a hypothesis which is not inconsistent with the doctrine of\\nUniformitarianism, with which geologists are familiar. That doctrine was\\nheld by Hutton, and in his earlier days by Lyell. Hutton was struck by\\nthe demonstration of astronomers that the perturbations of the planetary\\nbodies, however great they may be, yet sooner or later right themselves;\\nand that the solar system possesses a self-adjusting power by which\\nthese aberrations are all brought back to a mean condition. Hutton\\nimagined that the like might be true of terrestrial changes; although no\\none recognized more clearly than he the fact that the dry land is being\\nconstantly washed down by rain and rivers and deposited in the sea; and\\nthat thus, in a longer or shorter time, the inequalities of the earth\\'s\\nsurface must be leveled, and its high lards brought down to the ocean.\\nBut, taking into account the internal forces of the earth, which,\\nupheaving the sea bottom, give rise to new land, he thought that these\\noperations of degradation and elevation might compensate each other: and\\nthat thus, for any assignable time, the general features of our planet\\nmight remain what they are. And inasmuch as, under these circumstances,\\nthere need be no limit to the propagation of animals and plants, it is\\nclear that the consistent working out of the uniformitarian idea might\\nload to the conception of the eternity of the world. Not that I mean to\\nsay that either Hutton or Lyell held this conception--assuredly not;\\nthey would have been the first to repudiate it. Nevertheless, the\\nlogical development of their arguments lends directly towards this\\nhypothesis.\\n\\nThe second hypothesis supposes that the present order of things, at some\\nno very remote time, had a sudden origin, and that the world, such as it\\nnow is, had chaos for its phenomenal antecedent. That is the doctrine\\nwhich you will find stated most fully and clearly in the immortal poem\\nof John Milton,--the English _Divina Commedia,_--\"Paradise Lost.\" I\\nbelieve it is largely to the influence of that remarkable work, combined\\nwith the daily teachings to which we have all listened in our childhood,\\nthat this hypothesis owes its general wide diffusion as one of the\\ncurrent beliefs of English-speaking people. If you turn to the seventh\\nbook of \"Paradise Lost,\" you will find there stated the hypothesis to\\nwhich I refer, which is briefly this: That this visible universe of ours\\ncame into existence at no great distance of time from the present; and\\nthat the parts of which it is composed made their appearance, in a\\ncertain, definite order, in the space of six natural days, in such a\\nmanner that, on the first of these days, light appeared; that, on the\\nsecond, the firmament, or sky, separated the waters above, from the\\nwaters beneath the firmament; that, on the third day, the waters drew\\naway from the dry land, and upon it a varied vegetable life, similar to\\nthat which now exists, made its appearance; that the fourth day was\\nsignalized by the apparition of the sun, the stars, the moon, and the\\nplanets; that, on the fifth day, aquatic animals originated within the\\nwaters; that, on the sixth day, the earth gave rise to our four-footed\\nterrestrial creatures, and to all varieties of terrestrial animals\\nexcept birds, which had appeared on the preceding day; and, finally,\\nthat man appeared upon the earth, and the emergence of the universe from\\nchaos was finished. Milton tells us, without the least ambiguity, what a\\nspectator of these marvelous occurrences would have witnessed. I doubt\\nnot that his poem is familiar to all of you, but I should like to recall\\none passage to your minds, in order that I may be justified in what I\\nhave said regarding the perfectly concrete, definite picture of the\\norigin of the animal world which Milton draws. He says:\\n\\n  \"The sixth, and of creation last, arose\\n  With evening harps and matin, when God said,\\n  \\'Let tine earth bring forth soul living in her kind,\\n  Cattle and creeping things, and beast of the earth,\\n  Each in their kind!\\' The earth obeyed, and, straight\\n  Opening her fertile womb, teemed at a birth.\\n  Innumerous living creatures, perfect forms,\\n  Limbed and full-grown. Out of the ground uprose,\\n  As from his lair, the wild beast, where he wons\\n  In forest wild, in thicket, brake, or den:\\n  Among the trees in pairs they rose, they walked;\\n  The cattle in the fields and meadows green;\\n  Those rare and solitary; these in flocks\\n  Pasturing at once, and in broad herds upsprung.\\n  The grassy clods now calved; now half appears\\n  The tawny lion, pawing to get free\\n  His hinder parts--then springs, as broke from bonds,\\n  And rampant shakes his brinded mane; the ounce,\\n  The libbard, and the tiger, as the mole\\n  Rising, the crumbled earth above them threw\\n  In hillocks; the swift stag from underground\\n  Bore up his branching head; scarce from his mould\\n  Behemoth, biggest born of earth, upheaved\\n  His vastness; fleeced the flocks and bleating rose\\n  As plants; ambiguous between sea and land,\\n  The river-horse and scaly crocodile.\\n  At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,\\n  Insect or worm.\"\\n\\nThere is no doubt as to the meaning of this statement, nor as to what a\\nman of Milton\\'s genius expected would have been actually visible to an\\neyewitness of this mode of origination of living things.\\n\\nThe third hypothesis, or the hypothesis of evolution, supposes that, at\\nany comparatively late period of past time, our imaginary spectator\\nwould meet with a state of things very similar to that which now\\nobtains; but that the likeness of the past to the present would\\ngradually become less and less, in proportion to the remoteness of his\\nperiod of observation from the present day: that the existing\\ndistribution of mountains and plains, of rivers and seas, would show\\nitself to be the product of a slow process of natural change operating\\nupon more and more widely different antecedent conditions of the mineral\\nframework of the earth; until, at length, in place of that framework, he\\nwould behold only a vast nebulous mass, representing the constituents of\\nthe sun and of the planetary bodies. Preceding the forms of life which\\nnow exist, our observer would see animals and plants not identical with\\nthem, but like them: increasing their differences with their antiquity,\\nand at the same time becoming simpler and simpler; until, finally, the\\nworld of life would present nothing but that undifferentiated\\nprotoplasmic matter which, so far as our present knowledge goes, is the\\ncommon foundation of all vital activity.\\n\\nThe hypothesis of evolution supposes that in all this vast progression\\nthere would be no breach of continuity, no point at which we could say\\n\"This is a natural process,\" and \"This is not a natural\\nprocess\"; but\\nthat the whole might be compared to that wonderful process of\\ndevelopment which may be seen going on every day under our eyes, in\\nvirtue of which there arises, out of the semifluid, comparatively\\nhomogeneous substance which we call an egg, the complicated organization\\nof one of the higher animals. That, in a few words, is what is meant by\\nthe hypothesis of evolution.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nI have already suggested that in dealing with these three hypotheses, in\\nendeavoring to form a judgment as to which of them is the more worthy of\\nbelief, or whether none is worthy of belief--in which case our\\ncondition of mind should be that suspension of judgment which is so\\ndifficult to all but trained intellects,--we should be indifferent to\\nall _a priori_ considerations. The question is a question of historical\\nfact. The universe has come into existence somehow or other, and the\\nproblem is, whether it came into existence in one fashion, or whether it\\ncame into existence in another; and, as an essential preliminary to\\nfurther discussion, permit me to say two or three words as to the nature\\nand the kinds of historical evidence.\\n\\nThe evidence as to the occurrence of any event in past time may be\\nranged under two heads, which, for convenience\\' sake, I will speak of as\\ntestimonial evidence and as circumstantial evidence. By testimonial\\nevidence I mean human testimony; and by circumstantial evidence I mean\\nevidence which is not human testimony. Let me illustrate by a familiar\\nexample what I understand by these two kinds of evidence, and what is to\\nbe said respecting their value.\\n\\nSuppose that a man tells you that he saw a person strike another and\\nkill him; that is testimonial evidence of the fact of murder. But it is\\npossible to have circumstantial evidence of the fact of murder; that is\\nto say, you may find a man dying with a wound upon his head having\\nexactly the form and character of the wound which is made by an ax, and,\\nwith due care in taking surrounding circumstances into account, you may\\nconclude with the utmost certainty that the man has been murdered; that\\nhis death is the consequence of a blow inflicted by another man with\\nthat implement. We are very much in the habit of considering\\ncircumstantial evidence as of less value than testimonial evidence, and\\nit may be that, where the circumstances are not perfectly clear and\\nintelligible, it is a dangerous and unsafe kind of evidence; but it must\\nnot be forgotten that, in many cases, circumstantial evidence is quite\\nas conclusive as testimonial evidence, and that, not unfrequently, it is\\na great deal weightier than testimonial evidence. For example, take the\\ncase to which I referred just now. The circumstantial evidence may be\\nbetter and more convincing than the testimonial evidence; for it may be\\nimpossible, under the conditions that I have defined, to suppose that\\nthe man met his death from any cause but the violent blow of an ax\\nwielded by another man. The circumstantial evidence in favor of a murder\\nhaving been committed, in that case, is as complete and as convincing as\\nevidence can be. It is evidence which is open to no doubt and to no\\nfalsification. But the testimony of a witness is open to multitudinous\\ndoubts. He may have been mistaken. He may have been actuated by malice.\\nIt has constantly happened that even an accurate man has declared that a\\nthing has happened in this, that, or the other way, when a careful\\nanalysis of the circumstantial evidence has shown that it did not happen\\nin that way, but in some other way.\\n\\nWe may now consider the evidence in favor of or against the three\\nhypotheses. Let me first direct your attention to what is to be said\\nabout the hypothesis of the eternity of the state of things in which we\\nnow live. What will first strike you is, that it is a hypothesis which,\\nwhether true or false, is not capable of verification by any evidence.\\nFor, in order to obtain either circumstantial or testimonial evidence\\nsufficient to prove the eternity of duration of the present state of\\nnature, you must have an eternity of witnesses or an infinity of\\ncircumstances, and neither of these is attainable. It is utterly\\nimpossible that such evidence should be carried beyond a certain point\\nof time; and all that could be said, at most, would be, that so far as\\nthe evidence could be traced, there was nothing to contradict the\\nhypothesis. But when you look, not to the testimonial evidence--which,\\nconsidering the relative insignificance of the antiquity of human\\nrecords, might not be good for much in this case--but to the\\ncircumstantial evidence, then you will find that this hypothesis is\\nabsolutely incompatible with such evidence as we have; which is of so\\nplain and so simple a character that it is impossible in any way to\\nescape from the conclusions which it forces upon us.\\n\\nYou are, doubtless, all aware that the outer substance of the earth,\\nwhich alone is accessible to direct observation, is not of a homogeneous\\ncharacter, but that it is made up of a number of layers or strata, the\\ntitles of the principal groups of which are placed upon the\\naccompanying diagram.[68] Each of these groups represents a number of\\nbeds of sand, of stone, of clay, of slate, and of various other\\nmaterials.\\n\\nOn careful examination, it is found that the materials of which each of\\nthese layers of more or less hard rock are composed are, for the most\\npart, of the same nature as those which are at present being formed\\nunder known conditions on the surface of the earth. For example, the\\nchalk, which constitutes a great part of the Cretaceous formation in\\nsome parts of the world, is practically identical in its physical and\\nchemical characters with a substance which is now being formed at the\\nbottom of the Atlantic Ocean, and covers an enormous area; other beds of\\nrock are comparable with the sands which art; being formed upon\\nseashores, packed together, and so on. Thus, omitting rocks of igneous\\norigin, it is demonstrable that all these beds of stone, of which a\\ntotal of not less than seventy thousand feet is known, have been formed\\nby natural agencies, either out of the waste and washing of the dry\\nland, or else by the accumulation of the exuviae of plants and animals.\\nMany of these strata are full of such exuviae--the so-called\\n\"fossils.\"\\n\\nRemains of thousands of species of animals and plants, as perfectly\\nrecognizable as those of existing forms of life which you meet with in\\nmuseums, or as the shells which you pick up upon the seabeach, have been\\nembedded in the ancient sands, or muds, or limestones, just as they are\\nbeing embedded now, in sandy, or clayey, or calcareous subaqueous\\ndeposits. They furnish us with a record, the general nature of which\\ncannot be misinterpreted, of the kinds of things that have lived upon\\nthy surface of the earth during the time that is registered by this\\ngreat thickness of stratified rocks. But even a superficial study of\\nthese fossils shows us that the animals and plants which live at the\\npresent time have had only a temporary duration; for the remains of such\\nmodern forms of life are met with, for the most part, only in\\nthe uppermost or latest tertiaries, and their number rapidly diminishes\\nin the lower deposits of that epoch. In the older tertiaries, the places\\nof existing animals and plants are taken by other forms, as numerous and\\ndiversified as those which live now in the same localities, but more or\\nless different from them; in the Mesozoic rocks, these are replaced by\\nothers yet more divergent from modern types; and in the Paleozoic\\nformations the contrast is still more marked. Thus the circumstantial\\nevidence absolutely negatives the conception of the eternity of the\\npresent condition of things. We can say with certainly that the present\\ncondition of things has existed for a comparatively short period; and\\nthat, so far as animal and vegetable nature are concerned, it has been\\npreceded by a different condition. We can pursue this evidence until we\\nreach the lowest of the stratified rocks, in which we lose the\\nindications of life altogether. The hypothesis of the eternity of the\\npresent state of nature may therefore be put out of court.\\n\\nWe now come to what I will term Milton\\'s hypothesis--the hypothesis that\\nthe present condition of things has endured for a comparatively short\\ntime; and, at the commencement of that time, came into existence within\\nthe course of six days. I doubt not that it may have excited some\\nsurprise in your minds that I should have spoken of this as Milton\\'s\\nhypothesis, rather than that I should have chosen the terms which are\\nmore customary, such as \"the doctrine of creation,\" or the \"Biblical\\ndoctrine,\" or \"the doctrine of Moses,\" all of which denominations, as\\napplied to the hypothesis to which I have just referred, are certainly\\nmuch more familiar to you than the title of the Miltonic hypothesis. But\\nI have had what I cannot but think are very weighty reasons for taking\\nthe course which T have pursued. In the first place, I have discarded\\nthe title of the doctrine of \"creation,\" because my present business is\\nnot with the question why the objects which constitute Nature came into\\nexistence, but when they came into existence, and in what order. This is\\nas strictly a historical question as the question when the Angles and\\nthe Jutes invaded England, and whether they preceded or followed the\\nRomans. But the question about creation is a philosophical problem, and\\none which cannot be solved, or even approached, by the historical\\nmethod. What we want to learn is, whether the facts, so far as they are\\nknown, afford evidence that things arose in the way described-by Milton,\\nor whether they do not; and, when that question is settled, it will be\\ntime enough to inquire into the causes of their origination.\\n\\nIn the second place, I have not spoken of this doctrine as the Biblical\\ndoctrine, It is quite true that persons as diverse in their general\\nviews as Milton the Protestant and the celebrated Jesuit Father Suarez,\\neach put upon the first chapter of Genesis the interpretation embodied\\nin Milton\\'s poem. It is quite true that this interpretation is that\\nwhich has been instilled into every one of us in our childhood; but I do\\nnot for one moment venture to say that it can properly be called the\\nBiblical doctrine. It is not my business, and does not lie within my\\ncompetency, to say what the Hebrew text does, and what it does not\\nsignify; moreover, were I to affirm that this is the Biblical doctrine,\\nI should be met by the authority of many eminent scholars, to say\\nnothing of men of science, who, at various times, have absolutely denied\\nthat any such doctrine is to be found in Genesis. If we are to listen to\\nmany expositors of no mean authority, we must believe that what seems so\\nclearly defined in Genesis--as if very great pains had been taken that\\nthere should be no possibility of mistake--is not the meaning of the\\ntext at all. The account is divided into periods that we may make just\\nas long or short as convenience requires. We are also to understand that\\nit is consistent with the original text to believe that the most complex\\nplants and animals may have been evolved by natural processes, lasting\\nfor millions of years, out of structureless rudiments. A person who is\\nnot a Hebrew scholar can only stand aside and admire the marvelous\\nflexibility of a language which admits of such diverse interpretations.\\nBut assuredly, in the face of such contradictions of authority upon\\nmatters respecting which he is incompetent to form any judgment, he will\\nabstain, as I do, from giving any opinion.\\n\\nIn the third place, I have carefully abstained from speaking of this as\\nthe Mosaic doctrine, because we are now assured upon the authority of\\nthe highest critics, and even of dignitaries of the Church, that there\\nis no evidence that Moses wrote the Book of Genesis, or knew anything\\nabout it. You will understand that I give no judgment--it would be an\\nimpertinence upon my part to volunteer even a suggestion--upon such a\\nsubject. But, that being the state of opinion among the scholars and the\\nclergy, it is well for the unlearned in Hebrew lore, and for the laity,\\nto avoid entangling themselves in such a vexed question. Happily, Milton\\nleaves us no excuse for doubting what he means, and I shall therefore be\\nsafe in speaking of the opinion in question as the Miltonic hypothesis.\\n\\nNow we have to test that hypothesis. For my part, I have no prejudice\\none way or the other. If there is evidence in favor of this view, I am\\nburdened by no theoretical difficulties in the way of accepting it: but\\nthere must be evidence. Scientific men get an awkward habit--no, I won\\'t\\ncall it that, for it is a valuable habit--of believing nothing unless\\nthere is evidence for it; and they have a way of looking upon belief\\nwhich is not based upon evidence, not only as illogical, but as immoral.\\nWe will, if you please, test this view by the circumstantial evidence\\nalone; for, from what I have said, you will understand that I do not\\npropose to discuss the question of what testimonial evidence is to be\\nadduced in favor of it. If those whose business it is to judge are not\\nat one as to the authenticity of the only evidence of that kind which is\\noffered, nor as to the facts to which it bears witness, the discussion\\nof such evidence is superfluous.\\n\\nBut I may be permitted to regret this necessity of rejecting the\\ntestimonial evidence the less, because the examination of the\\ncircumstantial evidence leads to the conclusion, not only that it is\\nincompetent to justify the hypothesis, but that, so far as it goes, it\\nis contrary to the hypothesis.\\n\\nThe considerations upon which I base this conclusion are of the simplest\\npossible character. The Miltonic hypothesis contains assertions of a\\nvery definite character relating to the succession of living forms. It\\nis stated that plants, for example, made their appearance upon the third\\nday, and not before. And you will understand that what the poet means\\nby plants are such plants as now live, the ancestors, in the ordinary\\nway of propagation of like by like, of the trees and shrubs which\\nflourish in the present world. It must needs be so; for, if they were\\ndifferent, either the existing plants have been the result of a separate\\norigination since that described by Milton, of which we have no record,\\nnor any ground for supposition that such an occurrence has taken place;\\nor else they have arisen by a process of evolution from the original\\nstocks.\\n\\nIn the second place, it is clear that there was no animal life before\\nthe fifth day, and that, on the fifth day, aquatic animals and birds\\nappeared. And. it is further clear that terrestrial living things, other\\nthan birds, made their appearance upon the sixth day, and not before.\\nHence, it follows that, if, in the large mass of circumstantial evidence\\nas to what really has happened in the past history of the globe, we find\\nindications of the existence of terrestrial animals, other than birds,\\nat a certain period, it is perfectly certain that all that has taken\\nplace since that time must be referred to the sixth day.\\n\\nIn the great Carboniferous formation,[69] whence America derives so vast\\na proportion of her actual and potential wealth, in the beds of coal\\nwhich have been formed from the vegetation of that period, we find\\nabundant evidence of the existence of terrestrial animals. They have\\nbeen described, not only by European but by your own naturalists. There\\nare to be found numerous insects allied to our cockroaches. There are to\\nbe found spiders and scorpions of large size, the latter so similar to\\nexisting scorpions that it requires the practiced eye of the naturalist\\nto distinguish them. Inasmuch as these animals can be proved to have\\nbeen alive in the Carboniferous epoch, it is perfectly clear that, if\\nthe Miltonic account is to be accepted, the huge mass of rocks extending\\nfrom the middle of the Paleozoic formations to the uppermost members of\\nthe series, must belong to the day which is termed by Milton the sixth.\\nBut, further, it is expressly stated that aquatic animals took their\\norigin upon the fifth day, and not before; hence, all formations in\\nwhich remains of aquatic animals can be proved to exist, and which\\ntherefore testify that such animals lived at the time when these\\nformations were in course of deposition, must have been deposited during\\nor since the period which Milton speaks of as the fifth. But there is\\nabsolutely no fossiliferous formation in which the remains of aquatic\\nanimals are absent. The oldest fossils in the Silurian rocks[70] are\\nexuviae of marine animals; and if the view which is entertained by\\nPrincipal Dawson and Dr. Carpenter respecting the nature of the _eozooen_\\nbe well founded, aquatic animals existed at a period as far antecedent\\nto the deposition of the coal as the coal is from us; inasmuch as the\\n_eozooen_ is met with in those Laurentian strata which lie at the bottom\\nof the series of stratified rocks. Hence it follows, plainly enough,\\nthat the whole series of stratified rocks, if they are to be brought\\ninto harmony with Milton, must be referred to the fifth and sixth days,\\nand that we cannot hope to find the slightest trace of the products of\\nthe earlier days in the geological record. When we consider these simple\\nfacts, we see how absolutely futile are the attempts that have been made\\nto draw a parallel between the story told by so much of the crust of the\\nearth as is known to us and the story which Milton tells. The whole\\nseries of fossiliferous stratified rocks must be referred to the last\\ntwo days; and neither the Carboniferous, nor any other, formation can\\nafford evidence of the work of the third day.\\n\\nNot only is there this objection to any attempt to establish a harmony\\nbetween the Miltonic account and the facts recorded in the fossiliferous\\nrocks, but there is a further difficulty. According to the Miltonic\\naccount, the order in which animals should have made their appearance in\\nthe stratified rocks would be this: Fishes, including the great whales,\\nand birds; after them, all varieties of terrestrial animals except\\nbirds.\\n\\nNothing could be further from the facts as we find them; we know of not\\nthe slightest evidence of the existence of birds before the Jurassic, or\\nperhaps the Triassic, formation;[71] while terrestrial animals, as we\\nhave just seen, occur in the Carboniferous rocks.\\n\\nIf there were any harmony between the Miltonic account and the\\ncircumstantial evidence, we ought to have abundant evidence of the\\nexistence of birds in the Carboniferous, the Devonian, and the Silurian\\nrocks. I need hardly say that this is not the case, and that not a trace\\nof birds makes its appearance until the Tar later period which I have\\nmentioned.\\n\\nAnd again, if it be true that all varieties of fishes and the great\\nwhales, and the like, made their appearance on the fifth day, we ought\\nto find the remains of these animals in the older rocks--in those which\\nwere deposited before the Carboniferous epoch. Fishes we do find, in\\nconsiderable number and variety; but the great whales are absent, and\\nthe fishes are not such as now live. Not one solitary species of fish\\nnow in existence is to be found in the Devonian or Silurian formations.\\nHence we are introduced afresh to the dilemma which I have already\\nplaced before you: either the animals which came into existence on the\\nfifth day were not such as those which are found at present, are not the\\ndirect and immediate ancestors of those which now exist; in which case\\neither fresh creations of which nothing is said, or a process of\\nevolution must have occurred; or else the whole story must be given up\\nas not only devoid of any circumstantial evidence, but contrary to such\\nevidence as exists.\\n\\nI placed before you in a few words, some little time ago, a statement of\\nthe sum and substance of Milton\\'s hypothesis. Let me now try to state as\\nbriefly, the effect of the circumstantial evidence bearing upon the past\\nhistory of the earth which is furnished, without the possibility of\\nmistake, with no chance of error as to its chief features, by the\\nstratified rocks. What we find is, that the great series of formations\\nrepresents a period of time of which our human chronologies hardly\\nafford us a unit of measure. I will not pretend to say how we ought to\\nestimate this time, in millions or in billions of years. For my purpose,\\nthe determination of its absolute duration is wholly unessential. But\\nthat the time was enormous there can be no question.\\n\\nIt results from the simplest methods of interpretation, that leaving out\\nof view certain patches of metamorphosed rocks, and certain volcanic\\nproducts, all that is now dry land has once been at the bottom of the\\nwaters. It is perfectly certain that, at a comparatively recent period\\nof the world\\'s history--the Cretaceous epoch--none of the great physical\\nfeatures which at present mark the surface of the globe existed. It is\\ncertain that the Rocky Mountains were not. It is certain that the\\nHimalaya Mountains were not. It is certain that the Alps and the\\nPyrenees had no existence. The evidence is of the plainest possible\\ncharacter, and is simply this:--We find raised up on the flanks of these\\nmountains, elevated by the forces of upheaval which have given rise to\\nthem, masses of Cretaceous rock which formed the bottom of the sea\\nbefore those mountains existed. It is therefore clear that the elevatory\\nforces which gave rise to the mountains operated subsequently to the\\nCretaceous epoch; and that the mountains themselves are largely made up\\nof the materials deposited in the sea which once occupied their place.\\nAs we go back in time, we meet with constant alternations of sea and\\nland, of estuary and open ocean; and, in correspondence with these\\nalternations, we observe the changes in the fauna and flora to which I\\nhave referred.\\n\\nBut the inspection of these changes gives us no right to believe that\\nthere has been any discontinuity in natural processes. There is no trace\\nof general cataclysms, of universal deluges, or sudden destructions of a\\nwhole fauna or flora. The appearances which were formerly interpreted in\\nthat way have all been shown to be delusive, as our knowledge has\\nincreased and as the blanks which formerly appeared to exist between the\\ndifferent formations have been filled up. That there is no absolute\\nbreak between formation and formation, that there has been no sudden\\ndisappearance of all the forms of life and replacement of them by\\nothers, but that changes have gone on slowly and gradually, that one\\ntype has died out and another has taken its place, and that thus, by\\ninsensible degrees, one fauna has been replaced by another, are\\nconclusions strengthened by constantly increasing evidence. So that\\nwithin the whole of the immense period indicated by the fossiliferous\\nstratified rocks, there is assuredly not the slightest proof of any\\nbreak in the uniformity of Nature\\'s operations, no indication that\\nevents have followed other than a clear and orderly sequence.\\n\\nThat, I say, is the natural and obvious teaching of the circumstantial\\nevidence contained in the stratified rocks. I leave you to consider how\\nfar, by any ingenuity of interpretation, by any stretching of the\\nmeaning of language, it can be brought into harmony with the Miltonic\\nhypothesis.\\n\\nThere remains the third hypothesis, that of which I have spoken as the\\nhypothesis of evolution; and I purpose that, in lectures to come, we\\nshould discuss it as carefully as we have considered the other two\\nhypotheses. I need not say that it is quite hopeless to look for\\ntestimonial evidence of evolution. The very nature of the case precludes\\nthe possibility of such evidence, for the human race can no more be\\nexpected to testify to its own origin, than a child can be tendered as a\\nwitness of its own birth. Our sole inquiry is, what foundation\\ncircumstantial evidence lends to the hypothesis, or whether it lends\\nnone, or whether it controverts the hypothesis. I shall deal with the\\nmatter entirely as a question of history. I shall not indulge in the\\ndiscussion of any speculative probabilities. I shall not attempt to show\\nthat Nature is unintelligible unless we adopt some such hypothesis. For\\nanything I know about the matter, it may be the way of Nature to be\\nunintelligible; she is often puzzling, and I have no reason to suppose\\nthat she is bound to fit herself to our notions.\\n\\nI shall place before you three kinds of evidence entirely based upon\\nwhat is known of the forms of animal life which are contained in the\\nseries of stratified rocks. I shall endeavor to show you that there is\\none kind of evidence which is neutral, which neither helps evolution nor\\nis inconsistent with it. I shall then bring forward a second kind of\\nevidence which indicates a strong probability in favor of evolution, but\\ndoes not prove it; and, lastly, I shall adduce a third kind of evidence\\nwhich, being as complete as any evidence which we can hope to obtain\\nupon such a subject, and being wholly and strikingly in favor of\\nevolution, may fairly be called demonstrative evidence of its\\noccurrence.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE TRANSMISSION OF YELLOW FEVER BY MOSQUITOES\\n\\nGEORGE M. STERNBERG, M.D., L.L.D, SURGEON-GENERAL U.S. ARMY[72]\\n\\nThis article is a scientific demonstration of a new fact. It shows\\nclearly the processes of scientific reasoning based on the methods known\\nto Logic as the Methods of Agreement and Difference. The theory that the\\ngerms of the disease are carried by mosquitoes seems first to have\\nsuggested itself to Dr. Sternberg and to Dr. Finlay through noticing a\\nsimilarity of phenomena in many cases under different conditions. Yet,\\nhowever plausible, the theory, neither of them could declare that he had\\ndiscovered the fact until the experiments carried on under rigorous\\nprecautions had been tried. By these experiments all other causes were\\nruled out of consideration.\\n\\nThe discoveries which have been made in the past twenty-five years with\\nreference to the etiology[73] of infectious diseases constitute the\\ngreatest achievement of scientific medicine and afford a substantial\\nbasis for the application of intelligent measures of prophylaxis.[74] We\\nknow the specific cause (\"germ\") of typhoid fever, of pulmonary\\nconsumption, of cholera, of diphtheria, of erysipelas, of croupous\\npneumonia, of the malarial fevers, and of various other infectious\\ndiseases of man and of the domestic animals, but, up to the present\\ntime, all efforts to discover the germ of yellow fever have been without\\nsuccess. The present writer, as a member of the Havana Yellow Fever\\nCommission, in 1879, made the first systematic attempt to solve the\\nunsettled questions relating to yellow fever etiology by modern methods\\nof research.\\n\\nNaturally the first and most important question to engage my attention\\nwas that relating to the specific infectious agent, or \"germ,\" which\\nthere was every reason to believe must be found in the bodies of\\ninfected individuals. Was this germ present in the blood, as in the case\\nof relapsing fever; or was it to be found in the organs and tissues\\nwhich upon post-mortem examination give evidence of pathological\\nchanges, as in typhoid fever, pneumonia, and diphtheria; or was it to be\\nfound in the alimentary canal, as in cholera and dysentery?\\n\\nThe clinical history of the disease indicated a general blood\\ninfection. As my equipment included the best microscopical apparatus\\nmade, I had strong hopes that in properly stained preparations of blood\\ntaken from the circulation of yellow fever patients my Zeiss 1-18 oil\\nimmersion objective would reveal to me the germ I was in search of. But\\nI was doomed to disappointment. Repeated examinations of blood from\\npatients in every stage of the disease failed to demonstrate the\\npresence of microorganisms of any kind. My subsequent investigations in\\nHavana, Vera Cruz, and Rio de Janeiro, made in 1887, 1888, and 1889,\\nwere equally unsuccessful. And numerous competent microscopists of\\nvarious nations have since searched in vain for this elusive germ.\\nAnother method of attacking this problem consists in introducing blood\\nfrom yellow fever patients or recent cadavers into various \"culture\\nmedia\" for the purpose of cultivating any germ that might be present.\\nExtended researches of this kind also gave a negative result, which in\\nmy final report I stated as follows:\\n\\n    The specific cause of yellow fever has not yet been demonstrated.\\n\\n    It is demonstrated that microorganisms, capable of development in\\n    the culture media usually employed by the bacteriologists, are only\\n    found in the blood and tissues of yellow fever cadavers in\\n    exceptional cases, when cultures are made very soon after death.\\n\\nSince this report was made, various investigators have attacked the\\nquestion of yellow fever etiology, and one of them has made very\\npositive claims to the discovery of the specific germ. I refer to the\\nItalian bacteriologist, Sanarelli. His researches were made in Brazil,\\nand, singularly enough, he found in the blood of the first case examined\\nby him a bacillus. It was present in large numbers, but this case\\nproved to be unique, for neither Sanarelli nor any one else has since;\\nfound it in such abundance. It has been found in small numbers in the\\nblood and tissues of yellow fever cadavers in a certain number of the\\ncases examined. But carefully conducted researches by competent\\nbacteriologists have failed to demonstrate its presence in a\\nconsiderable proportion of the cases, and the recent researches of Reed,\\nCarroll, and Agramonte, to which I shall shortly refer, demonstrate\\nconclusively that the bacillus of Sanarelli has nothing to do with the\\netiology of yellow fever.\\n\\nSo far as I am aware, Dr. Carlos Finlay, of Havana, Cuba, was the first\\nto suggest the transmission of yellow fever by mosquitoes. In a\\ncommunication made to the Academy of Sciences of Havana, in October,\\n1881, he gave an account of his first attempts to demonstrate the truth\\nof his theory. In a paper contributed to _The Edinburgh Medical Journal_\\nin 1894, Dr. Finlay gives a summary of his experimental inoculations up\\nto that date as follows:\\n\\nA summary account of the experiments performed by myself (and some also\\nby my friend, Dr. Delgado), during the last twelve years, will enable\\nthe reader to judge for himself. The experiment has consisted in first\\napplying a captive mosquito to a yellow fever patient, allowing it to\\nintroduce its lance and to fill itself with blood; next, after the lapse\\nof two or more days, applying the same mosquito to the skin of a person\\nwho is considered susceptible to yellow fever: and, finally, observing\\nthe effects, not only during the first two weeks, but during periods of\\nseveral years, so as to appreciate the amount of immunity that should\\nfollow.\\n\\nBetween the 30th of June, 1881, and the 2d of December, 1893,\\neighty-eight persons have been so inoculated. All were white adults,\\nuniting the conditions which justify the assumption that they were\\nsusceptible to yellow fever. Only three were women. The chronological\\ndistribution of the inoculations was as follows: seven in 1881, ten in\\n1883, nine in 1885, three in 1886, twelve in 1887, nine in 1888, seven\\nin 1889, ten in 1890, eight in 1891, three in 1892, and ten in 1893.\\n\\nThe yellow fever patients upon whom the mosquitoes were contaminated\\nwere, almost in every instance, well-marked cases of the albuminuric or\\nmelanoalbuminuric forms, in the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth\\nday of the disease. In some of the susceptible subjects, the inoculation\\nwas repeated when the source of the contamination appeared uncertain.\\n\\nAmong the eighty-seven who have been under observation, the following\\nresults have been recorded:\\n\\nWithin a term of days, varying between five and twenty-five after the\\ninoculation, _one_ presented a mild albuminuric attack, and _thirteen,\\nonly_ \"acclimation fevers.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nWhile Finlay\\'s theory appeared to be plausible and to explain many of\\nthe facts relating to the etiology of yellow fever, his experimental\\ninoculations not only failed to give it substantial support, but the\\nnegative results, as reported, by himself, seemed to be opposed to the\\nview that yellow fever is transmitted by the mosquito. It is true that\\nhe reports one case which \"presented a mild albuminuric attack\" which we\\nmay accept as an attack of yellow fever. But in view of the fact that\\nthis case occurred in the city of Havana, where yellow fever is endemic,\\nand of the eighty-six negative results from similar inoculations, the\\ninference seemed justified that in this case the disease was contracted\\nin some other way than as a result of the so-called \"mosquito\\ninoculation.\" The thirteen cases in which only \"acclimation fevers\"\\noccurred \"within a term of days varying between five and twenty-five\\nafter the inoculation\" appeared to me to have no value as giving support\\nto Finlay\\'s theory; first, because these \"acclimation fevers\" could not\\nbe identified as mild cases of yellow fever; second, because the\\nordinary method of incubation in yellow fever, is less than five days;\\nand, third, because these individuals, having recently arrived in\\nHavana, were liable to attacks of yellow fever, or of \"acclimation\\nfever\" as a result of their residence in this city and quite\\nindependently of Dr. Finlay\\'s mosquito inoculations. For these reasons\\nDr. Finlay\\'s experiments failed to convince the medical profession\\ngenerally of the truth of his theory relating to the transmission of\\nyellow fever, and this important question remained in doubt and a\\nsubject of controversy. One party regarded the disease as personally\\ncontagious and supposed it to be communicated directly from the sick to\\nthe well, as in the case of other contagious diseases, such as smallpox,\\nscarlet fever, etc. Opposed to this theory was the fact that in\\ninnumerable instances nonimmune persons had been known to care for\\nyellow-fever patients as nurses, or physicians, without contracting the\\ndisease; also the fact that the epidemic extension of the disease\\ndepends upon external conditions relating to temperature, altitude,\\nrainfall, etc. It was a well-established fact that the disease is\\narrested by cold weather and does not prevail in northern latitudes or\\nat considerable altitudes. But diseases which are directly transmitted\\nfrom man to man by personal contact have no such limitations. The\\nalternate theory took account of the above-mentioned facts and assumed\\nthat the disease was indirectly transmitted from sick to well, as is the\\ncase in typhoid fever and cholera, and that its germ was capable of\\ndevelopment external to the human body when conditions were favorable.\\nThese conditions were believed to be a certain elevation of the\\ntemperature, the presence of moisture and suitable; organic pabulum\\n(filth) for the development of the germ. The two first-mentioned\\nconditions were known to be essential, the third was a subject of\\ncontroversy.\\n\\nYellow fever epidemics do not occur in the winter months in the\\ntemperate zone and they do not occur in arid regions. As epidemics have\\nfrequently prevailed in seacoast cities known to be in an insanitary\\ncondition, it has been generally assumed that the presence of\\ndecomposing organic material is favorable for the development of an\\nepidemic and that, like typhoid fever and cholera, yellow fever is a\\n\"filth disease.\" Opposed to this view, however, is the fact that\\nepidemics have frequently occurred in localities (e.g. at military\\nposts) where no local insanitary conditions were to be found. Moreover,\\nthere are marked differences in regard to the transmission of the\\nrecognized filth diseases--typhoid fever and cholera--and yellow fever.\\nThe first-mentioned diseases are largely propagated by means of a\\ncontaminated water supply, whereas there is no evidence that yellow\\nfever is ever communicated in this way. Typhoid fever and cholera\\nprevail in all parts of the world and may prevail at any season of the\\nyear, although cholera, as a rule, is a disease of the summer months. On\\nthe other hand, yellow fever has a very restricted area of prevalence\\nand is essentially a disease of seaboard cities and of warm climates.\\nEvidently neither of the theories referred to accounts for all of the\\nobserved facts with reference to the endemic prevalence and epidemic\\nextension of the disease under consideration.\\n\\nHaving for years given much thought to this subject, I became some time\\nsince impressed with the view that probably in yellow fever, as in the\\nmalarial fevers, there is an \"intermediate host.\" I therefore suggested\\nto Dr. Reed, president of the board appointed upon my recommendation for\\nthe study of this disease in the island of Cuba, that he should give\\nspecial attention to the possibility of transmission by some insect,\\nalthough the experiments of Finlay seemed to show that this insect was\\nnot a mosquito of the genus _Culex_, such as he had used in his\\ninoculation experiments. I also urged that efforts should be made to\\nascertain definitely whether the disease can be communicated from man to\\nman by blood inoculations. Evidently if this is the case the blood must\\ncontain the living infectious agent upon which the propagation of the\\ndisease depends, notwithstanding the fact that all attempts to\\ndemonstrate the presence of such a germ in the blood, by means of\\nmicroscope and culture methods, have proved unavailing. I had previously\\ndemonstrated by repeated experiments that inoculations of yellow fever\\nblood into lower animals--dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs--give a negative\\nresult, but this negative result might well be because these animals\\nwere not susceptible to the disease and could not be accepted as showing\\nthat the germ of yellow fever was not present in the blood. A single\\ninoculation experiment on man had been made in my presence in the city\\nof Vera Cruz, in 1887, by Dr. Daniel Ruiz, who was in charge of the\\ncivil hospital in that city. But this experiment was inconclusive for\\nthe reason that the patient from whom the blood was obtained was in the\\neighth day of the disease, and it was quite possible that the specific\\ngerm might have been present at an earlier period and that after a\\ncertain number of days the natural resources of the body are sufficient\\nto effect its destruction, or in some way to cause its disappearance\\nfrom the circulation.\\n\\nThis was the status of the question of yellow fever etiology when Dr.\\nReed and his associates commenced their investigations in Cuba during\\nthe summer of 1900. In a \"Preliminary Note,\" read at the meeting of the\\nAmerican Public Health Association, October 22, 1900, the board gave a\\nreport of three cases of yellow fever which they believed to be direct\\nresults of mosquito inoculations. Two of these were members of the\\nboard, viz., Dr. Jesse W. Lazear and Dr. James Carroll, who voluntarily\\nsubmitted themselves to the experiment. Dr. Carroll suffered a severe\\nattack of the disease and recovered, but Dr. Lazear fell a victim to his\\nenthusiasm and died in the cause of science and humanity. His death\\noccurred on September 25, after an illness of six days\\' duration. About\\nthe same time nine other individuals who volunteered for the experiment\\nwere bitten by infected mosquitoes--i.e. by mosquitoes which had\\npreviously been allowed to fill themselves with blood from yellow fever\\ncases--and in these cases the result was negative. In considering the\\nexperimental evidence thus far obtained, the attention of the members of\\nthe board was attracted by the fact that in the nine inoculations with a\\nnegative result \"the time elapsing between the biting of the mosquito\\nand the inoculation of the healthy subject varied in seven cases from\\ntwo to eight days, and in the remaining two from ten to thirteen days,\\nwhereas in two of the three successful cases the mosquito had been kept\\nfor twelve days or longer.\" In the third case, that of Dr. Lazear, the\\nfacts are stated in the report of the board as follows:\\n\\nCase 3. Dr. Jesse W. Lazear, Acting Assistant Surgeon U.S. Army, a\\nmember of this board, was bitten on August 16, 1900 (Case 3, Table III)\\nby a mosquito (_Culex fasciatus_), which ten days previously had been\\ncontaminated by biting a very mild case of yellow fever (fifth day). No\\nappreciable disturbance of health followed this inoculation.\\n\\nOn September 13, 1900 (forenoon), Dr. Lazear, while on a visit to Las\\nAnimas Hospital, and while collecting blood from yellow fever patients\\nfor study, was bitten by a _Culex_ mosquito (variety undetermined). As\\nDr. Lazear had been previously bitten by a contaminated insect without\\nafter effects, he deliberately allowed this particular mosquito, which\\nhad settled on the back of his hand, to remain until it had satisfied\\nits hunger.\\n\\nOn the evening of September 18, five days after the bite, Dr. Lazear\\ncomplained of feeling \"out of sorts,\" and had a chill at 8 P.M.\\n\\nOn September 19, twelve o\\'clock noon, his temperature was 102.4 deg., pulse\\n112; his eyes were injected and his face suffused; at 3 P.M. temperature\\nwas 103.4 deg., pulse 104; 6 P.M., temperature 103.8 deg. and pulse 106; albumin\\nappeared in the urine. Jaundice appeared on the third day. The\\nsubsequent history of this case was one of progressive and fatal yellow\\nfever, the death of our much-lamented colleague having occurred on the\\nevening of September 25, 1900.\\n\\nEvidently in this case the evidence is not satisfactory as to the fatal\\nattack being the result of the bite by a mosquito \"while on a visit to\\nLas Animas Hospital,\" although Dr. Lazear himself was thoroughly\\nconvinced that this was the direct cause of his attack.\\n\\nThe inference by Dr. Reed and his associates, from the experiments thus\\nfar made, was that yellow fever may be; transmitted by mosquitoes of the\\ngenus _Culex_, but that in order to convey the infection to a nonimmune\\nindividual the insect must be kept for twelve days or longer after it\\nhas filled itself with blood from a yellow fever patient in the earlier\\nstages of the disease. In other words, that a certain period of\\nincubation is required in the body of the insect before the germ reaches\\nits salivary glands, and consequently before it is able to inoculate any\\nindividual with the germs of yellow fever. This inference, based upon\\nexperimental data, received support from other observations, which have\\nbeen repeatedly made, with reference to the introduction and spread of\\nyellow fever in localities favorable to its propagation. When a case is\\nimported to one of our southern seaport cities, from Havana, Vera Cruz,\\nor some other endemic focus of the disease, an interval of two weeks or\\nmore occurs before secondary cases are developed as a result of such\\nimportation. In the light of our present knowledge this is readily\\nunderstood. A certain number of mosquitoes having filled themselves with\\nblood from this first case after an interval of twelve days or more bite\\nnonimmune individuals living in the vicinity, and these individuals\\nafter a brief period of incubation fall sick with the disease; being\\nbitten by other mosquitoes they serve to transmit the disease through\\nthe \"intermediate host\" to still others. Thus the epidemic extends, at\\nfirst slowly from house to house, then more rapidly, as by geometrical\\nprogression.\\n\\nIt will be seen that the essential difference between the successful\\nexperiments of the board of which Dr. Reed is president and the\\nunsuccessful experiments of Finlay consists of the length of time during\\nwhich the mosquitoes were kept after filling themselves with blood from\\na yellow fever patient. In Finlay\\'s experiments the interval was usually\\nshort,--from two to five or six days,--and it will be noted that in the\\nexperiments of Reed and his associates the result was invariably\\nnegative when the insect had been kept less than eight days (7 cases).\\n\\nHaving obtained what they considered satisfactory evidence that yellow\\nfever is transmitted by mosquitoes, Dr. Reed and his associates\\nproceeded to extend their experiments for the purpose of establishing\\nthe fact in such a positive manner that the medical profession and the\\nscientific world generally might be convinced of the reliability of the\\nexperimental evidence upon which their conclusions were based. These\\nconclusions, which have been fully justified by their subsequent\\nexperiments, were stated in their \"Preliminary Note\" as follows:\\n\\n    1. Bacillus icteroides (Sanarelli) stands in no causative relation\\n    to yellow fever, but, when present, should be considered as a\\n    secondary invader in this disease.\\n\\n    2. The mosquito serves as the intermediate host for the parasite of\\n    yellow fever.\\n\\nIn \"An Additional Note\" read at the Pan-American Medical Congress held\\nin Havana, Cuba, February 4,-7, 1901, a report is made of the further\\nexperiments made up to that date. In order that the absolute scientific\\nvalue of these experiments may be fully appreciated I shall quote quite\\nfreely from this report with reference to the methods adopted for the\\npurpose of excluding all sources of infection other than the mosquito\\ninoculation:\\n\\nIn order to exercise perfect control over the movements of those\\nindividuals who were to be subjected to experimentation, and to avoid\\nany other possible source of infection, a location was selected in an\\nopen and uncultivated field, about one mile from the town of Quemados,\\nCuba. Here an experimental sanitary station was established under the\\ncomplete control of the senior member of this board. This station was\\nnamed Camp Lazear, in honor of our late colleague, Dr. Jesse W. Lazear,\\nActing Assistant Surgeon U.S.A., who died of yellow fever, while\\ncourageously investigating the causation of this disease. The site\\nselected was well drained, freely exposed to sunlight and winds, and\\nfrom every point of view satisfactory for the purposes intended.\\n\\nThe personnel of this camp consisted of two medical officers, Dr. Roger\\nP. Ames, Acting Assistant Surgeon U.S.A., an immune, in immediate\\ncharge; Dr. R. P. Cooke, Acting Assistant Surgeon U.S.A., nonimmune; one\\nacting hospital steward, an immune; nine privates of the hospital corps,\\none of whom was immune, and one immune ambulance driver.\\n\\nFor the quartering of this detachment, and of such nonimmune individuals\\nas should be received for experimentation, hospital tents, properly\\nfloored, were provided. These were placed at a distance of about twenty\\nfeet from each other, and numbered 1 to 7 respectively.\\n\\nCamp Lazear was established November 20, 1900, and from this date was\\nstrictly quarantined, no one being permitted to leave or enter camp\\nexcept the three immune members of the detachment and the members of the\\nboard. Supplies were drawn chiefly from Columbia Barracks, and for this\\npurpose a conveyance under the control of an immune acting hospital\\nsteward, and having an immune driver, was used.\\n\\nA few Spanish immigrants recently arrived at the port of Havana were\\nreceived at Camp Lazear, from time to time, while these observations\\nwere being carried out. A nonimmune person, having once left the camp,\\nwas not permitted to return to it under any circumstances whatsoever.\\n\\nThe temperature and pulse of all nonimmune residents were carefully\\nrecorded three times a day. Under these circumstances any infected\\nindividual entering the camp could be promptly detected and removed. As\\na matter of fact, only two persons, not the subject of experimentation,\\ndeveloped any rise of temperature; one, a Spanish immigrant, with\\nprobable commencing pulmonary tuberculosis, who was discharged at the\\nend of three days: and the other, a Spanish immigrant, who developed a\\ntemperature of 102.6 deg. F. on the afternoon of his fourth day in camp. He\\nwas at once removed with his entire bedding and baggage and placed in\\nthe receiving ward at Columbia Barracks. His fever, which was marked by\\ndaily intermissions for three days, subsided upon the administration of\\ncathartics and enemata. His attack was considered to be due to\\nintestinal irritation. He was not permitted, however, to return to the\\ncamp.\\n\\nNo nonimmune resident was subjected to inoculation who had not passed in\\nthis camp the full period of incubation of yellow fever, with one\\nexception, to be hereinafter mentioned.\\n\\nFor the purpose of experimentation subjects were selected as follows:\\nFrom Tent No. 2, 2 nonimmunes, and from Tent No. 5, 3 nonimmunes. Later,\\n1 nonimmune in Tent No. 6 was also designated for inoculation.\\n\\nIt should be borne in mind that at the time when these inoculations were\\nbegun, there were only 12 nonimmune residents at Camp Lazear, and that 5\\nof those were selected for experiment, viz., 2 in Tent No. 2, and 3 in\\nTent No. 5. Of these we succeeded in infecting 4, viz., 1 in Tent No. 2.\\nand 3 in Tent No. 5, each of whom developed an attack of yellow fever\\nwithin the period of incubation of this disease. The one negative\\nresult, therefore, was in Case 2--Moran--inoculated with a mosquito on\\nthe fifteenth day after the insect had bitten a case of yellow-fever on\\nthe third day. Since this mosquito failed to infect Case 4, three days\\nafter it had bitten Moran, it follows that the result could not have\\nbeen otherwise than negative in the latter case. We now know, as the\\nresult of our observations, that in the case of an insect kept at room\\ntemperature during the cool weather of November, fifteen or even\\neighteen days would, in all probability, be too short a time to render\\nit capable of producing the disease.\\n\\nAs bearing upon the source of infection, we invite attention to the\\nperiod of time during which the subjects had been kept under rigid\\nquarantine, prior to successful inoculation, which was as follows: Case\\n1, fifteen days; Case 3, nine days; Case 4, nineteen days; Case 5,\\ntwenty-one days. We further desire to emphasize the fact that this\\nepidemic of yellow fever, which affected 33.33 per cent of the nonimmune\\nresidents of Camp Lazear, did not concern the seven nonimmunes occupying\\nTents Nos, 1, 4, 6 and 7, _but was strictly limited to those individuals\\nwho had been bitten by contaminated mosquitoes._\\n\\nNothing could point more forcibly to the source of this infection than\\nthe order of the occurrence of events at this camp. The precision with\\nwhich the infection of the individual followed the bite of the mosquito\\nleft nothing to be desired in order to fulfill the requirements of a\\nscientific experiment.\\n\\nIn summing up their results at the conclusion of this report the\\nfollowing statement is made:\\n\\nOut of a total or eighteen nonimmunes whom we have inoculated with\\ncontaminated mosquitoes, since we began this line of investigation,\\neight, or 44.4 per cent, have contracted yellow fever. If we exclude\\nthose individuals bitten by mosquitoes that had been kept less than\\ntwelve days after contamination, and which were therefore probably\\nincapable of conveying the disease, we have to record eight positive and\\ntwo negative results--80 per cent.\\n\\nIn a still later report (May, 1901) Dr. Reed says, \"We have thus far\\nsucceeded in conveying yellow fever to twelve individuals by means of\\nthe bites of contaminated mosquitoes.\"\\n\\nThe nonimmune individuals experimented upon were all fully informed as\\nto the nature of the experiment and its probable results and all gave\\ntheir full consent. Fortunately no one of these brave volunteers in the\\ncause of science and humanity suffered a fatal attack of the disease,\\nalthough several were very ill and gave great anxiety to the members of\\nthe board, who fully appreciated the grave responsibility which rested\\nupon them. That these experiments were justifiable under the\\ncircumstances mentioned is, I believe, beyond question. In no other way\\ncould the fact established have been demonstrated, and the knowledge\\ngained is of inestimable value as a guide to reliable measures of\\nprevention. Already it is being applied in Cuba, and without doubt\\ninnumerable lives will be saved as a result of these experiments showing\\nthe precise method by which yellow fever is contracted by those exposed\\nin an \"infected locality.\" Some of these volunteers were enlisted men of\\nthe United States Army and some were Spanish immigrants who had recently\\narrived in Cuba. When taken sick they received the best possible care,\\nand after their recovery they had the advantage of being \"immunes\" who\\nhad nothing further to fear from the disease which has caused the death\\nof thousands and tens of thousands of Spanish soldiers and immigrants\\nwho have come to Cuba under the orders of their government or to seek\\ntheir fortunes.\\n\\nThe experiments already referred to show in the most conclusive manner\\nthat the blood of yellow fever patients contains the infectious agent,\\nor germ, to which the disease is due, and this has been further\\ndemonstrated by direct inoculations from man to man. This experiment was\\nmade by Dr. Reed at \"Camp Lazear\" upon four individuals, who freely\\nconsented to it; and in three of the four a typical attack of yellow\\nfever resulted from the blood injection. The blood was taken from a vein\\nat the bend of the elbow on the first or second day of sickness and was\\ninjected subcutaneously into the four nonimmune individuals, the amount\\nbeing in one positive case 2 cc, in one 1.5 cc, and in one O.5 cc. In\\nthe case attended with a negative result, a Spanish immigrant, a\\nmosquito inoculation also proved to be without effect, and Dr. Reed\\nsupposes that this individual \"probably possesses a natural immunity to\\nyellow fever.\" Dr. Reed says with reference to these experiments:\\n\\nIt is important to note that in the three cases in which the injection\\nof the blood brought about an attack of yellow fever, careful culture\\nfrom the same blood, taken immediately after injection, failed to show\\nthe presence of Sanarelli\\'s bacillus.\\n\\nHaving demonstrated the fact that yellow fever is propagated by\\nmosquitoes, Dr. Reed and his associates have endeavored to ascertain\\nwhether it may also be propagated, as has been commonly supposed, by\\nclothing, bedding, and other articles which have been in use by those\\nsick with this disease. With reference to the experiments made for the\\nsolution of this question I cannot do better than to quote _in extensa_\\nfrom Dr. Reed\\'s paper read at the Pan-American Medical Congress in\\nHavana.\\n\\n[This extract from Dr. Reed\\'s paper describes in careful scientific\\ndetail the experiments which finally established the fact that the\\ncontagion came through mosquitoes, and in no other way. Into a small\\nhouse, thoroughly air-proof, were brought bedclothes, clothing, and\\nother articles which had been contaminated by yellow fever patients.\\nThen for twenty days men who were nonimmune to the fever slept in this\\nbuilding, with no evil effects. This experiment was repeated several\\ntimes. Then in another building similar, except that it was ventilated\\nby mosquito-proof windows, and had been thoroughly disinfected, another\\nvolunteer was bitten by mosquitoes which had first bitten patients\\nsuffering with yellow fever; and he developed the disease. The last\\nparagraph of the extract is as follows:]\\n\\n    \"Thus at Camp Lazear, of seven nonimmunes whom we attempted to\\n    infect by means of the bites of contaminated mosquitoes, we have\\n    succeeded in conveying the disease to six, or 85.71 per cent. On the\\n    other hand, of seven nonimmunes whom we tried to infect by means of\\n    fomites [cloth and other material generally capable of carrying\\n    germs] under particularly favorable circumstances, we did not\\n    succeed in a single instance.\"\\n\\nIt is evident that in view of our present knowledge relating to the mode\\nof transmission of yellow fever, the preventive measures which have\\nheretofore been considered most important, that is, isolation of the\\nsick, disinfection of clothing and bedding, and municipal sanitation,\\nare either of no avail or of comparatively little value. It is true that\\nyellow fever epidemics have resulted, as a rule, from the introduction\\nto a previously healthy locality of one or more persons suffering from\\nthe disease. But we now know that its extension did not depend upon the\\ndirect contact of the sick with the nonimmune individuals and that\\nisolation of the sick from such contact is unnecessary and without\\navail. On the other hand, complete isolation from the agent which is\\nresponsible for the propagation of the disease is all-important. In the\\nabsence of a yellow fever patient from which to draw blood the mosquito\\nis harmless, and in the absence of the mosquito the yellow fever patient\\nis harmless--as the experimental evidence now stands. Yellow fever\\nepidemics are terminated by cold weather because the mosquitoes die or\\nbecome torpid. The sanitary condition of our southern seaport cities is\\nno better in winter than in summer, and if the infection attached to\\nclothing and bedding it is difficult to understand why the first frosts\\nof autumn should arrest the progress of an epidemic. But all this is\\nexplained now that the mode of transmission has been demonstrated.\\n\\nInsanitary local conditions may, however, have a certain influence in\\nthe propagation of the disease, for it has been ascertained that the\\nspecies of mosquito which serves as an intermediate host for the yellow\\nfever germ may breed in cesspools and sewers, as well as in stagnant\\npools of water. If, therefore, the streets of a city are unpaved and\\nungraded and there are open spaces where water may accumulate in pools,\\nas well as open cesspools to serve as breeding places for _Culex\\nfasciatus_, the city will present conditions more favorable for the\\npropagation of yellow fever than it would if well paved and drained and\\nsewered.\\n\\nThe question whether yellow fever may be transmitted by any other\\nspecies of mosquito than _Culex fasciatus_ has not been determined.\\nFacts relating to the propagation of the disease indicate that the\\nmosquito which serves as an intermediate host for the yellow fever germ\\nhas a somewhat restricted geographical range and is to be found\\nespecially upon the seacoast and the margins of rivers in the so-called\\n\"yellow fever zone.\" While occasional epidemics have occurred upon the\\nsouthwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula, the disease, as an epidemic,\\nis unknown elsewhere in Europe, and there is no evidence that it has\\never invaded the great and populous continent of Asia. In Africa it is\\nlimited to the west coast. In North America, although it has\\noccasionally prevailed as an epidemic in every one of our seaport cities\\nas far north as Boston, and in the Mississippi Valley as far north as\\nSt. Louis, it has never established itself as an epidemic disease within\\nthe limits of the United States. Vera Cruz, and probably other points on\\nthe Gulf coast of Mexico, are, however, at the present time, endemic\\nfoci of the disease. In South America it has prevailed as an epidemic at\\nall of the seaports on the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, as far south as\\nMontevideo and Buenos Aires, and on the Pacific along the coast of Peru.\\n\\nThe region in which the disease has had the greatest and most frequent\\nprevalence is bounded by the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, and includes\\nthe West India islands. Within the past few years yellow fever has been\\ncarried to the west coast of North America, and has prevailed as an\\nepidemic as far north as the Mexican port of Guaymas, on the Gulf of\\nCalifornia.\\n\\nIt must be supposed that _Culex fasciatus_ is only found where yellow\\nfever prevails. The propagation of the disease depends upon the\\nintroduction of an infected individual to a locality where this mosquito\\nis found, at a season of the year when it is active. Owing to the short\\nperiod of incubation (five days or less), the brief duration of the\\ndisease and especially of the period during which the infectious agent\\n(germ) is found in the blood, it is evident that ships sailing from\\ninfected ports, upon which cases of yellow fever develop, are not likely\\nto introduce the disease to distant seaports. The continuance of an\\nepidemic on shipboard, as on the land, must depend upon the presence of\\ninfected mosquitoes and of nonimmune individuals. Under these conditions\\nwe can readily understand why the disease should not be carried from the\\nWest Indies or from South America to the Mediterranean, to the east\\ncoast of Africa, or to Asiatic seaport cities. On the other hand, if the\\ndisease could be transmitted by infected clothing, bedding, etc., there\\nseems no good reason why it should not have been carried to these\\ndistant localities long ago.\\n\\nThe restriction as regards altitude, however, probably depends upon the\\nfact that the mosquito which serves as an intermediate host is a coast\\nspecies, which does not live in elevated regions. It is a\\nwell-established fact that yellow fever has never prevailed in the City\\nof Mexico, although the city has constant and unrestricted intercourse\\nwith the infected seaport, Vera Cruz. Persons who have been exposed in\\nVera Cruz during the epidemic season frequently fall sick after their\\narrival in the City of Mexico, but they do not communicate the disease\\nto those in attendance upon them or to others in the vicinity. Evidently\\nsome factor essential for the propagation of the disease is absent,\\nalthough we have the sick man, his clothing and bedding, and the\\ninsanitary local conditions which have been supposed to constitute an\\nessential factor. I am not aware that any observations have been made\\nwith reference to the presence or absence of _Culex fasciatus_ in high\\naltitudes, but the inference that it is not to be found in such\\nlocalities as the City of Mexico seems justified by the established\\nfacts already referred to.\\n\\nAs pointed out by Hirsch, \"the disease stops short at many points in the\\nWest Indies where the climate is still in the highest degree tropical.\"\\nIn the Antilles it has rarely appeared at a height of more than seven\\nhundred feet. In the United States the most elevated locality in which\\nthe disease has prevailed as an epidemic is Chattanooga, Tennessee,\\nwhich is seven hundred and forty-five feet above sea level.\\n\\nIt will be remembered that the malarial fevers are contracted as a\\nresult of inoculation by mosquitoes of the genus _Anopheles_, and that\\nthe malarial parasite has been demonstrated not only in the blood of\\nthose suffering from malarial infection, but also in the stomach and\\nsalivary glands of the mosquito. If the yellow fever parasite resembled\\nthat of the malarial fevers, it would no doubt have been discovered long\\nago. But, as a matter of fact, this parasite, which we now know is\\npresent in the blood of those sick with the disease, has thus far eluded\\nall researches. Possibly it is ultramicroscopic. However this may be, it\\nis not the only infectious disease germ which remains to be discovered.\\nThere is no doubt a living germ in vaccine lymph and in the virus from\\nsmallpox pustules, but it has not been demonstrated by the microscope.\\nThe same is true of foot and mouth disease and of infectious\\npleuropneumonia of cattle, although we know that a living element of\\nsome kind is present in the infectious material by which these diseases\\nare propagated. In Texas fever, of cattle, which is transmitted by\\ninfected ticks, the parasite is very minute, but by proper staining\\nmethods and a good microscope it may be detected in the interior of the\\nred blood corpuscles. Drs. Reed and Carroll are at present engaged in a\\nsearch for the yellow fever germ in the blood and in the bodies of\\ninfected mosquitoes. What success may attend their efforts remains to be\\nseen, but at all events the fundamental facts have been demonstrated\\nthat this germ is present in the blood and that the disease is\\ntransmitted by a certain species of mosquito--_Culex fasciatus_.\\n\\n[At the end of the article General Sternberg reproduces the general\\norders issued to the army in Cuba with directions for the precautions to\\nbe taken against the disease.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE WORKMAN\\'S COMPENSATION ACT[75]\\n\\nThis is a good example of the high quality of argumentative writing\\nwhich is being turned out by daily and weekly journals in great\\nquantities throughout the year. This article, being from a weekly\\njournal, is longer and more searching than the editorial in a daily\\npaper, and to some extent partakes of the nature of an essay. It is\\nnotable for the thoroughness of the analysis of the question, for the\\ncareful review of the history of the case, and for the precise statement\\nof the points at issue. There is little space for the presentation of\\nevidence, though the specific statement of facts and the quotations from\\nauthorities, so far as they go, serve as evidence.\\n\\nWe purpose in this article to give to our readers an interpretation of\\nthe recent decision of the New York Court of Appeals declaring that the\\nWorkman\\'s Compensation Act is unconstitutional. We regard this decision\\nas of very great importance, because, if the Court has correctly\\ninterpreted the Constitution of the United States, that document\\nprevents America from adopting an industrial reform which has been\\nadopted as just and necessary by practically the entire civilized world.\\nWe do not believe that the interpretation of the Court is correct. It\\nis, in our opinion, in conflict alike with the progress of civilization,\\nthe spirit of democracy, the principles of social justice, and the\\nanalogies and tendencies of law. And we believe that this unconscious\\nattempt to fasten upon the workingman an unjust and intolerable burden\\nfrom which all other civilized nations, with one exception, have\\nrelieved him, will ultimately prove as futile as was the conscious and\\ndeliberate attempt of the United States Supreme Court, under the lead of\\nChief Justice Taney, to halt the movement for the emancipation of the\\nslaves.\\n\\nIn the earlier stages of industrial development, when industry was\\nunorganized, machinery hardly existed, and labor was an individual\\nhandicraft, the courts naturally assumed that accidents occurring to a\\nworkman were probably due to his own negligence.\\n\\nIf he were mowing in a field and cut himself with his scythe, if he\\nwere digging a ditch and sprained his ankle, if he were cutting down a\\ntree and it fell upon him and broke his leg, he could recover from his\\nemployer only on proof that his employer was at fault. Nor could he\\nrecover if the accident were due to the carelessness of a fellow\\nworkman. There was always a natural presumption that he could better\\nguard against such carelessness than could the probably absent employer.\\nIf he were turning a grindstone and his awkward fellow workman so held\\nthe scythe as to cut him, if he were in the forest and his fellow\\nworkman gave no notice of the falling tree, it was natural to presume\\nthat the carelessness was shared between the two, and the law would\\nneither attribute blame to the employer nor levy the damage upon him\\nwhen he was not blameworthy.\\n\\nBut the organization of labor and the creation of elaborate machinery\\nhas destroyed this presumption of the common sense, and therefore in all\\ncivilized countries has destroyed this presumption of law. When a\\nrailway train runs off the track because of a misplaced switch or a\\ndefective rail, there is no presumption that the engineer was careless\\nor could have guarded against the carelessness of the switch tender or\\nof the manufacturer of the rail. When a fire breaks out in a room where\\nscores of shirt-waist makers are confined at their work and a hundred\\nand forty of them are burned to death, there is no presumption that the\\nimpossibility of their escape through narrow passageways and a locked\\ndoor was due to their carelessness, or that they were to blame because\\nthe tables at which they were working were wood, not metal, or that they\\ncould have prevented the careless fellow workman from throwing his\\ncigarette down in the inflammable material which surrounded them. In\\nfact, only a very limited number of modern accidents are due to the\\ncarelessness of the injured party; probably a somewhat larger number are\\ndue to the carelessness of some other employee; while a very\\nconsiderable proportion are incidents of the trade and due to no\\ndefinite culpability which it is possible to trace home either to the\\nemployer or the employed.\\n\\nThe Christian nations of the world have, with singular unanimity,\\nrecognized this change, and have changed their laws to meet the new\\nconditions. The change which they have made was indicated to them by\\ntheir maritime laws, which in this respect have been alike in all\\ncivilized nations and from a very early period. An accident occurring to\\na sailor on shipboard has always been regarded as an accident to the\\nship; and the ship has always been required to bear the burden of his\\ncare and keep and cure. This right to be cared for does not rest on any\\nassumption that the master of the ship has been negligent, nor is the\\nseaman deprived of his right to care and keep and cure by proof that the\\naccident was due in part, or even altogether, to his negligence. He is\\nnot debarred from recovery by proof of his carelessness; he is not given\\nlarger damages upon proof of the negligence of the master. His right to\\nbe cared for rests, says Mr. Justice Story, upon the fact that \"seamen\\nare in some sort co-adventurers upon the voyage.\" Modern jurisprudence\\nthroughout Christendom recognizes that under modern industrial\\nconditions the workman in the railway, the mine, and the factory is a\\nco-adventurer in the enterprise, and that the hazards incident to his\\nemployment should be borne, not by the individual, but by the industry.\\nThis principle is now recognized and incorporated in their legal,\\nsystems by every country in Europe (including Russia but not Turkey)\\nwith the single exception of Switzerland.[76]\\n\\nThe justice and importance of this reform have been recognized by such\\nstatesmen as the President of the United States and his predecessor in\\noffice, by such lawyers as Elihu Root, by workmen who desire some better\\ninsurance against accident than is furnished them by a right to sue\\ntheir employers, by employers who desire to be protected from vexatious\\nlawsuits and the peril of verdicts for great sums, and by about half a\\ndozen states, including Kansas, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and New York,\\nall of which have passed Workmen\\'s Compensation Acts. Such an act,\\nshifting the responsibility for the risks which are incident to the\\ntrade in organized industry from the individual to the organization, the\\nNew York Court of Appeals declares no state in the Union has authority\\nto enact, because the Constitution of the United States forbids its\\nenactment. The Court recognizes the need for a change in the Law. \"We\\ndesire,\" says the Court, \"to present no purely technical or\\nhypercritical obstacles to any plan for the beneficent reformation of a\\nbranch of our jurisprudence in which, it may be conceded, reform is a\\nconsummation devoutly to be wished.\" It presents forcibly,\\nappreciatively, and apparently with entire approbation, the arguments\\nwhich have brought about this reform in other lands: \"There can be no\\ndoubt as to the theory of this law. It is based upon the proposition\\nthat the inherent risks of an employment should, in justice, be placed\\nupon the shoulders of the employer, who can protect himself against loss\\nby insurance, and by such an addition to the price of his wares as to\\ncast the burden ultimately upon the consumer; that indemnity to an\\ninjured employee should be as much a charge upon the business as the\\ncost of replacing or repairing disabled or defective machinery,\\nappliances, or tools; that under our present system the loss falls\\nimmediately upon the employee, who is almost invariably unable to bear\\nit, and ultimately upon the community, which is taxed for the support of\\nthe indigent; and that our present system is uncertain, unscientific,\\nand wasteful, and fosters a spirit of antagonism between employer and\\nemployee which it is for the interest of the state to remedy.\"\\n\\nTo these considerations the Court suggests no reply, and upon them it\\noffers no criticism. On the contrary, it in terms concedes \"the strength\\nof this appeal to recognized and widely prevalent sentiment.\" It\\ndeclares that \"no word of praise could overstate the industry and\\nIntelligence of the Commission\" which prepared the New York law, and it\\napparently agrees with the conclusion of the Commission, based on \"a\\nmost voluminous array of statistical tables, extracts from the works of\\nphilosophical writers, and the industrial laws of many countries\"--the\\nconclusion that \"our own system of dealing with industrial accidents is\\neconomically, morally, and legally unsound.\" But all these\\nconsiderations of public policy, social justice, and world-wide\\nconviction are set aside \"as subordinate to the primary question whether\\nthey can be molded into statutes without infringing upon the letter or\\nspirit of our own written Constitution.\" The countries which have\\nadopted this desirable reform, it is said, \"are so-called constitutional\\nmonarchies in which, as in England, there is no written constitution,\\nand the Parliament or lawmaking body is supreme. In our country the\\nFederal and State Constitutions are the charters which demark the extent\\nand the limitation of legislative power.\"\\n\\nIn brief: The change in the law is just: it is demanded by the change\\nwhich has taken place in our industrial system; it is all but\\nuniversally desired; the experience and the conscience of the civilized\\nworld call for it; but America is powerless to make it under her present\\nConstitution. Other countries can make it because they are monarchies:\\nAmerica cannot make it because she is free.\\n\\nThe clause in the Constitution which, in the opinion of the Court of\\nAppeals, prohibits the legislature from making this wise and just reform\\nin our law is the clause which provides that \"no person shall be ...\\ndeprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law\"--a\\nprohibition which occurs twice in our Federal Constitution (Amendments V\\nand XIV), and is to be found in many, very probably in most, State\\nConstitutions. We believe that the Court of Appeals, in its contention\\nthat this clause in our Constitution prohibits this just and necessary\\nreform in our industrial laws, is sustained neither by the spirit nor by\\nthe letter of this clause in the Constitution, neither by the history of\\nits origin and significance nor by the course of judicial interpretation\\nwhich has been given to it by the United Slates Supreme Court.\\n\\nLet the reader stop a moment here and reflect upon the principle\\ninvolved in the law enacted in other civilized countries and proposed in\\nours. It is not that an employer should be mulcted in damages when he\\nhas been guilty of no fault. It is not that he should be compelled to\\npay for his carelessness without an opportunity to prove to the court\\nthat he has not been careless. It is that accidents occurring in the\\ncourse of organized industry should be held to have occurred, not to the\\nindividual, but to the industry.\\n\\n\"In everything within the sphere of human activity,\" says the Court of\\nAppeals, \"the risks which are inherent and unavoidable must fall upon\\nthose who are exposed to them.\" The jurists of all the civilized\\ncountries of Europe agree that in modern organized industries it is the\\nindustry, not the individual, that is exposed to the accidents. The law\\napplies to the factory hand for the future the principle heretofore\\napplied to the seaman in maritime law. The factory hand is henceforth to\\nbe regarded as a \"co-adventurer\" with the employer in the industry.\\n\\nNor is \"due process of law\" denied by the Workman\\'s Compensation Act. No\\ndamages can be recovered from the employer against his consent without a\\nsuit at law. The statute in terms provides that \"any question which\\nshall arise under this act shall be determined either by agreement or by\\narbitration as provided in the Code of Civil Procedure, or by an action\\nat law as herein provided.\" And what is provided is that, if the\\nemployer fail to make compensation as provided by the Act, the injured\\nparty or his guardian or executor may sue for the amount. The law does\\nnot deny the employer his day in court. But it redefines the question\\nfor the court to decide. It has not to decide whether the employer is\\nguilty of fault. His liability does not depend on his fault. The court\\nhas simply to decide whether the accident occurred in the due course of\\nthe business, and, if the employer chooses to raise the question,\\nwhether it was \"caused in whole or in part by the serious and willful\\nmisconduct of the workman.\" If not, the workman is entitled to recover,\\nand the amount which he is entitled to recover is fixed by the statute.\\nThe question, then, is this:\\n\\nDoes a law which, for accidents in certain carefully defined and\\nespecially dangerous employments, transfers the liability from the\\nindividual to the organization, and which carefully preserves the right\\nof the employer to submit any questions which arise under the law to the\\ncourts for adjudication, deprive the employer of his property without\\ndue process of law? The Court of Appeals of New York State affirms that\\nit does. _The Outlook_ affirms that it does not.\\n\\nTo state this question appears to us to answer it. Certainly there is\\nnothing in the Workman\\'s Compensation Act which violates the _letter_ of\\nthe Constitution. It does not in terms take the property of the employer\\nwithout due process of law. How any one can find in the act a violation\\nof the _spirit_ of the Constitution we find it difficult to conceive.\\nAnd that difficulty is enhanced, not relieved, by a careful study of the\\nopinions of the Court. For in those opinions it is assumed that on its\\nface the law is unconstitutional, and the Court devotes all its\\nintellectual energies to an attempt to show that the authorities cited\\nin opposition are exceptional. That the law and the Constitution are not\\ninconsistent is, however, established both by a consideration of the\\nobject and intent of the Constitutional provision and by judicial\\ndecisions interpreting it. To these two considerations we now direct the\\nattention of the reader.\\n\\nThe provision in the federal Constitution that \"no person shall be ...\\ndeprived of life, liberty, or property, except by due process of law\"\\n(Fifth Amendment), and the provision, \"nor shall any state deprive any\\nperson of life, liberty, or property without due process of law\"\\n(Fourteenth Amendment), are derived from the Great Charter wrested from\\nKing John by the Barons in 1215. \"No freeman shall be taken or\\nimprisoned, or disseized, or outlawed, or banished, or any ways\\ndestroyed, nor will we pass upon him, nor will we send upon him, unless\\nby the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.\" This is\\nperhaps the most important of those general clauses in the Great Charter\\nwhich, says Hallam in his \"History of the Middle Ages,\" \"protect the\\npersonal liberty and property of all freemen by giving security from\\narbitrary imprisonment and arbitrary spoliation.\" Hume gives some\\nintimation of the abuses that led to this provision: merchants had been\\nsubjected to arbitrary tolls and impositions; the property of the dying\\nhad been seized and their lawful heirs dispossessed; officers of the\\nCrown had levied on horses and carts in time of peace for their own or\\nthe public service. Green, in his \"History of the English People,\" gives\\nthe picture of John\\'s despotism and of the growing spirit of liberty in\\nthe English common people with greater detail The King\\'s exactions drove\\nthe Barons into alliance with the people. \"Illegal exactions, the\\nseizure of their castles, the preference shown to foreigners, were small\\nprovocations compared with his attacks on the honor of their wives and\\ndaughters.\" The demand of the common people to substitute due process of\\nlaw for wager by battle, and to be secure in their lives, their\\nliberties, and their property from acts of lawless and irresponsible\\npower, the Barons made their own, and by the same act claimed for others\\nwhat they claimed for themselves. \"The under tenants were protected\\nagainst all exactions of their lords in precisely the same terms as they\\nwere protected against the lawless exactions of the Crown.\"\\n\\nFrom such a provision for the protection of the fundamental rights of\\nperson and property it is a far cry to the conclusion that the people\\ncannot remedy the injustice which inflicts all the consequences of\\naccidents which occur in extrahazardous trades upon the individual who,\\nin practicing that trade, happens to be subjected to the peril. Common\\nsense, as well as frequent decisions of the courts, sustain Daniel\\nWebster\\'s definition of the scope of the Constitutional provision\\nembodying in our law this provision of the Great Charter: \"The meaning\\nis that every citizen shall hold his life, liberty, and property and\\nimmunities under the protection of general rules which govern society.\"\\nThat society can never make new rules for the better protection of life,\\nliberty, and property and immunities, is a doctrine as repugnant to\\nreason as it is to social progress. It is equally repugnant to the\\nprinciple of interpretation laid down by the Supreme Court of the United\\nStates: \"The law is perfectly well settled that the first ten amendments\\nto the Constitution, commonly known as the Bill of Rights, were not\\nintended to lay down any novel principles of government, but simply to\\nembody certain guarantees and immunities which we had inherited from our\\nEnglish ancestors.\"[77] And it seems never even to have occurred to\\nEnglish law makers that the Workman\\'s Compensation Act is inconsistent\\nwith this provision of their Great Charter--a charter which is as much a\\npart of the British constitution as the Fifth and Tenth Amendments are\\nof ours. In the English Constitution, as in the American, the principle\\nis carefully defined in writing. The only difference is that in England\\nthe Parliament is the final judge of its meaning; in the United States\\nthat final judge is the Supreme Court of the United States.\\n\\nAt least it ought to be. But the New York Court of Appeals does not\\nallow that it is the final authority. In this particular case it is not,\\nfor no appeal lies by the plaintiff in this case from the state to the\\nnational court. But an appeal does lie by the public. _The Outlook_ takes\\nsuch an appeal. And it declares without hesitation that the decision of\\nthe New York Court of Appeals is in conflict, not only with the trend of\\njudicial decisions in that Court, but also with its very explicit\\nstatement of the fundamental principles to be applied in interpreting\\nthe Constitution.\\n\\nWe have already noted the fact that maritime law regards a seaman as a\\nco-adventurer with the shipowner, and therefore makes the ship liable\\nfor his care, keep, and cure in case any accident occurs to him, even\\nthough it be produced by his own fault. We now add that the Supreme\\nCourt of the United States has decided that such a law does not take the\\nshipowner\\'s property without due process of law. That, says the Court of\\nAppeals, is different, for \"the contract and services of seamen are\\nexceptional in character ... When he is sick or injured he is entitled\\nto be cared for at the expense of the ship, and for the failure of the\\nmaster to perform his duty in this regard the ship or the owner is\\nliable.\" No doubt there is a difference between a seaman on a ship and a\\nfactory hand in a factory. Very probably that difference ought to weigh\\nwith the representatives of the people in determining what difference\\nthere should be in their respective treatment. But if making a ship\\nliable for accidents happening to a seaman does not take the shipowner\\'s\\nproperty without due process of law, then rendering a factory liable for\\naccidents happening to a factory hand does not lake the factory owner\\'s\\nproperty without due process of law. The Constitution of the United\\nStates is precisely the same on sea as on land; but to the Constitution\\nof the United Slates the Court of Appeals gives one meaning on shipboard\\nand another meaning in the town.\\n\\nThe right of the legislature to impose new responsibilities upon\\nproperty is not confined by the United States Supreme Court to the sea.\\nIt is equally sustained upon the land. The State of Oklahoma provided\\nfor an assessment on all banks in the State in order to create a fund\\nfor the purpose of guaranteeing the depositors in all banks in the\\nState. The Noble State Bank brought suit against the State to prevent it\\nfrom collecting this assessment, on the ground that it was taking\\nproperty without due process of law. The Supreme Court, without a\\ndissenting opinion, held that the act was constitutional, on two\\ngrounds: first, because \"it is established by a series of cases that an\\nulterior public advantage may justify a comparatively insignificant\\ntaking of private property for what in its immediate purpose is a\\nprivate use\"; and, second, because \"it may be said in a general way\\nthat the police power extends to all the great public needs. It may be\\nput forth in aid of what is sanctioned by usage or held by the\\nprevailing morality or strong and preponderant opinion to be greatly and\\nimmediately necessary to the public welfare.\" A similar case coming\\nbefore the Court from the State of Kansas was decided with the same\\nunanimity by the Court at the same time.[78]\\n\\nThis definition of Constitutional law by the unanimous opinion of the\\nSupreme Court of the United Slates, if accepted, clearly determines the\\nconstitutionality of the Workman\\'s Compensation Act. That this Act \"is\\nsanctioned by usage and held by the prevailing morality and strong and\\npreponderant opinion to be greatly and immediately necessary to the\\npublic welfare\" is proved by the fact that it is demanded alike by\\nemployer and employee, that it has been approved by the general public,\\nthat it is apparently regarded by the Court of Appeals itself as a\\nreform much to be desired, and that it has been adopted by every\\ncivilized country in Europe except Switzerland. The New York Court of\\nAppeals can find only one escape from this declaration of principle by\\nthe highest tribunal in the land, in these two cases, namely, a\\nrepudiation of the authority of that tribunal in these cases: \"We cannot\\nrecognize them as controlling our construction of our Constitution.\"\\n\\nIn this review of the decision of the New York Court of Appeals we have\\npassed by without comment some extraordinary statements which should not\\nbe passed by in any complete review--the statement that \"practically all\\nof these [European] countries are so-called constitutional monarchies in\\nwhich, as in England, there is no written constitution,\" whereas, in\\nfact, practically all of the European nations have written\\nconstitutions; and the statement that the Workman\\'s Compensation Act\\n\"does nothing to conserve the health, safety, or morals of the\\nemployee,\" whereas, in fact, it is aimed and purposed to accomplish all\\nthree results, and was urged in the English House of Lords by Lord\\nSalisbury specifically on the ground that \"to my mind the great\\nattraction of this bill is that I believe it will turn out a great\\nmachinery for the saving of human life.\"\\n\\nBut we have deliberately neglected all minor details in an endeavor to\\nput before our lay readers a true interpretation, and what we hope they\\nwill generally believe to be a just criticism, of this decision of the\\nhighest court of the Empire State. In that decision, in our opinion, the\\nCourt has disregarded all considerations of social justice and public\\npolicy, has set itself against the conscience and judgment of the\\ncivilized world, and in its forced interpretation of the Constitution\\nhas disregarded alike the history of the Constitution\\'s origin and of\\nits judicial interpretation by the highest court in the land.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPPENDIX II\\n\\nSOME SUGGESTIONS TO INSTRUCTORS\\n\\n\\nWhat is the purpose of a course in the writing of arguments? The\\narguments which it turns out cannot convince any one, since there is no\\none for them to convince; so that the immediate and tangible product of\\nthe course must be looked on as a by-product, and a by-product from\\nwhich there can be no salvage.\\n\\nWhat products, then, can teachers aim to produce? First, a vital respect\\nfor facts and for sound reasoning therefrom; second, the power so to\\nanalyze and marshal the facts in an obscure and complicated case as to\\nbring order and light out of confusion; and third, the appreciation of\\nother men\\'s point of view and training in the tact which will influence\\nthem. Incidentally a good course in argumentation should leave with its\\nstudents an acquaintance with certain effective and economical devices\\nfor going to work that should serve them well in later life.\\n\\nI will take up each of these points in order, and speak of a few methods\\nwhich I have found useful in practice.\\n\\nIn the first place, how can a teacher establish and strengthen the\\nveneration for fact and the suspicion of all unsupported assertion and\\n_a priori_ reasoning? Partly by judicious exercises, partly by quiet\\nguidance in the choice of subjects. Let a class cross-examine each other\\non their exact knowledge of the ultimate facts on some familiar subject.\\nOn the question of the value of Latin, for example, just how many of the\\nclass know no Latin? In a piece of their own writing, how many of the\\nwords are derived from the Latin? and what kind of words are they? Of\\nthe leaders in scholarship in the class how many know Latin? Of the best\\nwriters? Of the authors whose works they are studying in English\\nliterature, how many were trained in Latin? Of the authors of the\\ntextbooks in science how many? A few such questions as these will\\nsuggest others; and the members of the class should keep a record of how\\nmany such questions they can answer with precision. Very few people have\\nany exact command of facts on subjects about which they talk freely and\\nwith authority; and a young man who has had this truth borne in on him\\nby personal examination will come to writing an argument with more\\nmodesty and scrupulousness.\\n\\nThen a class can be guided away from the large subjects where of\\nnecessity their knowledge of facts is second-hand, and in which their\\narguments, being of necessity short, can touch only the surface of the\\nsubject. Here, I think, is where much of the ineffectiveness of courses\\nin argument is to be found. \"Judges should be elected by direct vote of\\nthe people,\" \"The right of suffrage should be limited by an educational\\ntest,\" \"Corporations engaged in interstate commerce should be required\\nto take out a federal license,\" are samples of propositions recommended\\nas subjects for arguments of two thousand words or less. No\\nundergraduate has the practical knowledge of affairs to judge the value\\nof facts adduced in support of such propositions, and except for the\\nmembers of debating teams, who spend time on their contests comparable\\nto that given by athletes to their sports, no undergraduate can make\\nhimself acquainted with the vast fields of economics and governmental\\ntheory covered by such subjects. To write an argument of twelve hundred\\nwords on such a subject will weaken rather than strengthen the respect\\nfor facts.\\n\\nWhat sort of subjects, then, can be used? This is, I confess, a question\\nnot altogether easy to answer; but I have had a try at an answer in the\\nlist of Subjects which is given in Chapter I, which can be adapted to\\nspecial conditions of time or place. In general a question which a\\nstudent would discuss of his own accord and with some warmth is the best\\nsubject for him. There are many such subjects in athletics: at this date\\nthe rules of football seem not yet settled beyond amendment, and the\\nmaterial for hunting facts in the records of past games is large; Dean\\nBriggs of Harvard is making an appeal to players to raise the level of\\nmanners and of ethics in baseball; do all your students agree with him?\\nShould the universities be allowed to use men in their graduate schools\\nas members of their teams? And what are the facts about the playing of\\nsuch men in the universities in which your students would be interested?\\n\\nThen there are various educational questions, on which the views of\\nstudents have real value, especially if they are based on some\\nexamination of facts in the course of writing an argument. President\\nLowell of Harvard told a body of students whom he was consulting that it\\ndid not make much difference what they wanted, but that their views when\\nset forth for the purpose of helping the authorities of the college were\\nof great value. The views of your class on examinations for entrance\\nwould be based on knowledge which a member of the faculty cannot have at\\nfirst-hand. What is the estimate of the relative difficulty of getting\\ninto various colleges, and on what figures from schools is the estimate\\nbased? For how many boys are languages easier or harder than history or\\nmathematics or science? Does admission by certificate provide sufficient\\nsafeguard for the standards of the college? Does a rigid prescription of\\nsubjects for examination distort the course for the high school? How\\nmany boys, who can be named, had their education injured by such\\nprescription? Should the standard for entrance or for graduation be\\nraised, or lowered, at your college? Should honor students be excused\\nfrom final examinations? Should they have special privileges? Should\\nfreshmen be required to be within college bounds at a fixed hour every\\nnight? Should class rushes be abolished? Here are only a few suggestions\\nof subjects which can be adapted to the needs and the knowledge of\\nspecial classes. They are of no value, however, unless the students are\\ndriven to gather facts, and to reason from these facts, not from general\\nimpressions. School catalogues, college catalogues, informal censuses,\\nreports of presidents and of committees, and other printed or oral\\nsources will help in the gathering of facts.\\n\\nThen there are the innumerable local and state questions that touch the\\nfathers of at least half of any class, and that the sons may be in the\\nway of hearing discussed at home, or may be sent to hear discussed in\\nlegislatures and city councils. Every instructor who takes a daily\\nnewspaper will be provided with more of these subjects than his class\\ncan use. For their facts the students can go to the newspapers, to\\nprinted reports, to the persons who are concerned with the questions\\nwhich they are going to argue. In some cases the students will get\\nvaluable interest and advice from the older men who have the active\\ncharge of the questions under discussion; and it is not inconceivable,\\nthat if some of the latter happen to be graduates of the college or\\nschool, they will even read the arguments and make helpful criticisms on\\nthem. The grateful interest of graduates is a source which has not been\\noverdrawn for aid in the processes of instruction.\\n\\nMany of the subjects which I have here offered as suggestions can be\\ndiscussed in part, at any rate, within the space of an editorial\\narticle; and that I conceive to be about the length which most arguments\\nwritten by students, except those in special courses, will run to. In so\\nshort a space, it is hardly necessary to point out, evidence cannot be\\npresented and discussed with the detail, say, of Webster\\'s \"Speech in\\nthe White Murder Case.\" It would be a good separate exercise to call for\\nsuch detailed presentation of evidence on some single point in the\\nargument. With most classes, however, the instructor cannot do much more\\nthan rule out wholly unsupported assertion, and insist that the\\ndistinction between fact and inference from fact shall be kept in sight.\\n\\nThe second of the results which an instructor in a course in\\nargumentation should aim for is the power to analyze complicated masses\\nof facts and so arrange them and present them as to bring order out of\\nconfusion. President Taft has said that Justice Hughes \"won his\\nreputation at the bar by his gift of boring to the innermost core of a\\nsubject\"; and that is what the drill on the introduction to the brief\\nshould to some degree impart to students. The orderly analysis of the\\nquestion, step by step, according to the admirable scheme devised by\\nProfessor Baker, cannot help implanting some understanding of what it\\nmeans to go to the heart of a question. Every man sooner or later, must\\nface complicated and puzzling questions; and the ordinary man will give\\nhimself a long start if he will thus put down on paper the points that\\ncan be urged on the two sides of a question, and then study them until\\nthe real points at issue emerge. Then the drill in laying out the\\nlogical skeleton of an argument, so plainly that no false or broken\\nconnection can escape detection, will strengthen the conscience for\\nclearness and coherence of thought; and the necessity for getting back\\nto ultimate facts for every assertion, and putting down the source from\\nwhich the facts are derived, will help to implant a wholesome respect\\nfor facts as something different from assertion.\\n\\nSince the argument written out is the final test of the thinking, some\\ncare must be taken that students do not obscure by careless paragraphing\\nand slovenly sentences such clearness of thought as they have attained\\nin their brief. I have found it useful to prescribe marginal titles to\\nthe paragraphs: a student who has struggled to find a single phrase that\\nwill cover all of a sprawling paragraph will have learned some respect\\nfor firmness of paragraphing. In general, an instructor has a right to\\ninsist that his class shall apply in practice all that they have learned\\nabout the ordinary devices for getting clearness and emphasis.\\n\\nIn the third place, this practice in writing arguments ought to leave\\nwith students a more developed idea of how to make readers look\\nfavorably on a proposition which they are urging. I have insisted, at\\nthe risk of seeming repetitious, on the need of considering the audience\\nwhose minds are to be won over; for what persuasiveness can mean apart\\nfrom specific persons to persuade I cannot conceive. Much of the\\nperfunctory emptiness of the textbooks when they get to this part of the\\nsubject comes from neglecting this very practical and obvious side of\\nmaking an argument. The difficulty it raises for arguments written in\\nclass work is just as obvious; more than most kinds of composition\\nwritten for practice, arguments run the risk of having no touch with\\nreality. Something may be done, however, if an instructor guides his\\nclass toward the kind of questions I have suggested above: an argument\\non the rules of football would be addressed to the Rules Committee, and\\nmost youths would know something of the prepossessions of so famous a\\nman as Mr. Camp; an argument on a college question would be addressed\\nto the faculty or the president, and it may be assumed that students\\nhave some idea of their general attitude on such matters. I have\\nfollowed the practice in my own sections of freshmen of requiring them\\nto put at the head of their brief and of their argument the audience\\nwhich they had in mind. Then when one comes to criticism and conference\\none can by a little cross-examination bring home to them the very\\npractical nature of this matter of persuasion.\\n\\nOne must be careful not to insist too strictly on the model and the\\nscheme of work laid down here, and in practically the same form in other\\nbooks. It is the best that has yet been devised, but any student who is\\nset to making a brief of one of the examples of argument at the end of\\nthis book will see for himself that there is no one infallible way of\\nmaking an argument. Each argument must adapt itself to its occasion and\\nits audience; and an instructor will be wise to keep himself awake to\\nthis truth by noting divergencies from the model. The rules which are\\nhere set forth and the model which is built on them are serviceable just\\nso long as they are serviceable, and no longer. Their chief service is\\ndone when they have set up in the minds of students a standard of\\neffectiveness in singling out and emphasizing the critical issues of a\\nquestion.\\n\\nAs to the exercises which should accompany the work in argument my\\nexperience with classes of five to six hundred freshmen leads me to\\nthink that their value to the student can hardly be overestimated. I\\nwill speak here of a few of them.\\n\\nThe exercises in the use of reference books is something that every\\nstudent ought to be put through. I found it simple and not too\\nextravagant of time to take my sections to the library in squads of ten\\nor a dozen, and show them and let them handle the principal books on the\\nlist. Then on the spot I gave each of them a sheet of theme paper on\\nwhich I had written some sort of fact drawn from one of these books, and\\ntold them to look up that fact and report on it. My object was to\\nconvince them that most ordinary facts can be looked up in less than\\nfive minutes. The material for this exercise I got by turning over the\\nreference books and jotting down almost anything that caught my eye. One\\ncan in this way get a great variety of facts in a very short time. In\\nsome libraries it might be possible to get members of the library staff\\nto share in this instruction; in all libraries one will find active\\ncooperation.\\n\\nFor the preliminary work on the argument we found that it was often\\npracticable and advisable to let the students pair off on the two sides\\nof the question, and work together through all the preliminaries. Two\\nmen thus working together often discuss themselves into the liveliest\\nkind of interest in their question; and almost always they come closer\\nto the important issues involved by sharpening their wits against each\\nother. Their arguments, too, are better, especially in the refutation,\\nfrom their knowing just what points can be made on the other side.\\n\\nIt is excellent practice, not only for the brief and the argument, but\\nalso for all other college work, to set the students to making briefs of\\nparts or wholes of the arguments printed here as examples, or of other\\narguments found outside. Not only lawyers, but other men of affairs,\\nconstantly have to digest and summarize papers; and skill in picking out\\nessential facts and the thread of thought from a document is a highly\\nvaluable asset for practical life. The exercise is sometimes irksome to\\nstudents, for it is hard work at first and calls for concentration of\\nmind: but it can be sweetened and made livelier by the competition of\\nclassroom discussion.\\n\\nAll through the work on the argument students may well be set to\\nwatching the daily papers and the magazines for examples of arguments,\\nand of good and bad reasoning. Very often an instructor can get, at the\\ncost of a cent or two apiece, a set of arguments printed in a newspaper\\nfor his class to analyze. Senators and representatives in Congress are\\nnotably willing to send copies of speeches, and these sometimes furnish\\ngood examples of both sound and unsound reasoning.\\n\\nIf time serves, instructors will do well to give a grounding in logic. I\\nhave inserted a brief discussion of the subject with the hope that it\\nwill furnish a basis for a short study; it can be reenforced by a few\\nweeks on such a manual as Jevons\\'s \"Primer of Logic,\" or Bode\\'s \"Outline\\nof Logic\" if there is time. Whatever be one\\'s view of the positive value\\nof deductive logic, there can be no doubt that every student should have\\nsome knowledge of the canons of inductive logic, and that a study of\\npropositions and syllogisms is a mighty sharpener of the discrimination\\nfor the real meaning of words and sentences.\\n\\nThe short chapter on debating I have added for the use of classes where\\na moderate amount of training in this most useful of exercises is\\npracticable. Debating may be looked at in two ways, either as training\\nin alertness and effectiveness in discussion, or as a form of\\nintercollegiate or interscholastic sport. On the latter aspect a\\nrecognized authority has said: \"Formal debate is a kind of game. In the\\ntime limit, the order of speakers, the alternation of sides, the give\\nand take of rebuttal, the fixed rules of conduct, the ethics of the\\ncontest, the qualifications for success, and the final awarding of\\nvictory, debate has much in common with tennis\";[79] and he develops the\\nlikeness through a page of rather fine print. From this point of view\\ndebating has keenly interested a small body of students; in some\\ncolleges it has been recognized by hatbands or other emblems of\\ndistinction for the successful \"teams\"; and it has developed an\\nelaborate apparatus of rules and of \"coaches.\" With the game in this\\nfull bloom I have not space to deal in this small book; for such\\nelaborate work of analysis and preparation one must go to special\\nmanuals which deal with it at length. I have confined myself to an\\napplication of the general principles of the subject to the spoken\\nargument, and to a few suggestions for preparing for and carrying on the\\nnot very formal discussions which the average man gets into in the\\nordinary run of life.\\n\\nEven where there is not time for systematic practice in debating, much\\nmay be done by extemporaneous five-minute speeches. There is\\nunquestionably an active movement among the best teachers of English for\\nmore stress on oral composition; they recognize that the power to stand\\nquietly and at one\\'s ease on one\\'s feet and explain one\\'s views clearly\\nand cogently will help any man in his life work.\\n\\nIn some cases there may be local or academic subjects under discussion\\nat the time the class is working on argument on which they can prepare\\nthemselves to speak. It may be possible to interest graduates of the\\nschool and college, so that they will give help in getting material, and\\nperhaps in judging and criticizing. Occasionally, perhaps, a man who has\\nthe actual settlement of a local question or a share in the settlement\\nmay be willing to hear the discussion. Any aid of this sort that will\\nbring the debate within the bounds of reality will add zest to it.\\n\\nFor the use of this book when a comparatively short time, perhaps six\\nweeks, is at the disposal of the instructor, my advice, based on the\\npractice worked out with my colleagues in the freshman course at\\nHarvard, would be to begin with Chapter I, and at the same time ask the\\nclass to hand in subjects for approval. This should be done a fortnight\\nahead of the main work, in order to allow changes of subject, after\\nconsultation if necessary. In connection with Chapter II would come\\nexercises in making briefs of one or more of the arguments in the back\\nof the book or of others provided for the purpose. Then would come the\\npreliminary work on the brief, the introduction to the brief. This it is\\nprofitable to treat as a separate piece of work, with a grade of its\\nown. At this stage would be the place for the exercises in the use of\\nreference books, which will lead naturally to looking up the material\\nfor the brief. If possible a conference should be given on the\\nintroduction to the brief. Then comes the next main step in the work,\\nthe brief. The work for this would naturally be accompanied by study of\\nChapter III, and by such exercises in the correction of bad briefing and\\nin correction of fallacies as the instructor finds time for. There\\nshould be another conference on the brief, and it should be rewritten if\\nnecessary. Instructors who have been through the subject will know from\\nsad experience that one rewriting and one conference may be only\\nstarters. Then comes the argument itself: this should be the climax, and\\nnot merely a perfunctory filling out of the brief. If it be at all\\npossible, the argument should be rewritten after a conference, and the\\nconference can hardly be too long. If the argument is fifteen hundred or\\ntwo thousand words long, a half an hour will be found a short time to go\\nover the whole with any thoroughness. No instructor in English needs to\\nhave it pointed out that conferences are his most efficient means of\\neducation.\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n[Footnote 1: See Lincoln\\'s speech at Galesburg and at Quincy, in the\\nLincoln-Douglas debates.]\\n\\n[Footnote 2: O.
